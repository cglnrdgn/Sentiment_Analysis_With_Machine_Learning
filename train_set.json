        "review_detail": "After seeing Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol: 1, I got to watch Vol. 2 the next day after seeing it. I liked the first one but didn't really know everything that was going on, but just knowing that she set off the kill 5 individuals who left her dead at her wedding. So I saw Kill Bill: Vol 2 and liked it highly. The movie answered all of my questions to the previous one and had much of a better story and was not unrealistic that much. We finally get to see Bill, who is played by David Carradine who had a really good role in the movie. There is a great conclusion to the movie and had a very good story, along with likable characters, my favorite being Budd. Overall, good movie that answers tons of questions. I recommend Kill Bill Vol. 2.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",

Won't give it away but you will more than likely be able to figure it out ten minutes into the movie. The only positive thing about the flick are the actors and actressess giving their characters persona and the character Tad Hamilton, since he's actually not JUST a slimeball one-dimensional character but actually a guy who does transform during the coarse of the movie, just like the other two leads.. Kinda cute but by the looks of it it didn't make it all that well at the box office. Looks cheap. 3/10",

        "review_detail": "I love this anime series, my only complaint is that it only lasted one season...then again the fact it was only on one season made it extremely easy to get the whole series on DVD as all I had to do was buy the box set. This anime features a guy and his kid sidekick as they start out as sort of trouble solvers. Being body guards, bounty hunting, name the price and they do it as long as it appears to be on the up and up. Well they take on a mysterious client that turns out to be an outlaw hence the journey into the stars commences. During this trip they find an android who seems almost human, they get into trouble with pirates, they commandeer a ship later named \"The Outlaw Star\", they run afoul of an alien beast woman, they get into trouble with an assassin, and they have many many action packed, but funny adventures on their way to solving the mysterious of something known as the Galactic Leyline. Like I said this series has it all...action, romance, and lots of humor to tickle your funny bone as well. The series starts out fast, stays fast in the middle and doesn't let up till the very end. Having the entire series uncut on DVD is pretty cool too, as the Japanese voices are a lot better especially Aisha Clan Clan who has a bit of an irritating voice in the American version.",

I had heard about him a couple of times, but basically knew nothing about this man. So, in a way this film was very educational. I think director Martin Scorsese did an amazing job of showcasing Howard Hughes life as a Hollywood filmmaker and Aviation pioneer. Every once in a while during the viewing of this film I felt as if I hadn't really accomplished anything in life. Hughes lived such a fascinating life compared to that of an average Joe. It is really kind of sad that his phobias got the best of him and he spend the final two decades of his life in isolation. Who knows what he could have accomplished.As for the performances, they were all amazing. I have never really been a fan of Leo, but I was really impressed with his performance. It was amazing. And the technical team was as impressive. The production design, costumes, cinematography, editing, etc, were all at top level. And I especially loved how Scorsese played around with the color filter to resemble the colorized pictures of the time.RATING: 4 STARS (****)",

There are only 3 main problems I have. One is explanations. Obviously this movie was made after the OT, but I felt it was supposed to be presented as the first one. A lot of things, such as lightsabers and mind tricks, are not explained and may confuse people. Second is acting. I actually don't see too much wrong with this, but here and there Jake Lloyd delivers a bad line, as well as his friends and such. Third is the corny parts. Examples are JarJar's battle scene and a bit of Anakin flying his starfighter to save the day. But all three things aren't too bad, and I only wish the IMDb offered 9.5 stars, because I just can't give it a 10. Oh well, a 9 is still an A.",

        "review_detail": "The Amityville Horror is once again a horror movie with surprisingly little gore and tries to build its based-on-true-events story with attention to psychological forces, tension building and a house. Some people compare it to The Shining. There is even the obligatory overhead shot referring to this movie. But they are worlds apart. This is so lazy and unimaginative in its execution that it is hardly lifted above the average. The house offered many possibilities to explore as a character (with its ghosts) but all the shots in and around the house are without any imagination. As Chelsea enters the roof there are few shots suggesting depth. As the ghosts are shown, they have almost no dramatic impact on the viewer. The transformation of George the father is not very insightful portrayed for the viewer: He turns from father to maniac in an instant and that's not very plausible. A plot twist could have helped the movie regain some interest half-way (e.g. George non-existent but only imagined, George a reincarnation of the original killer). But we are served a simple explanation (why has there to be one at all and why that simple?).Horror movies go through a difficult period. There is an audience out there, but we need more creativity from the people who make them. The true horror here lies in the making of another dismal product supported by Michael Bay and friends.",

Still it was okay, just not the same as the first one or the second one, though it picks right up where the last one left off. Of course you must ignore the fact Reggie tossed that shotgun in the first one and now he has it and Jody is played by a different guy, other than that I can roll with it. A bit to much humor is used in this one too, as this also takes away from the movie's spookiness as well. Still the scene with the robbers going into the house and being hunted down by the kid is pretty cool and there are other scenes that make this movie enjoyable and not boring. It just explains to much and how many of those death globes do ya need in a flick and their origin is stupid as well.

Though, soon later the two come across the Website and race against the clock to solve the mystery before they become a victim of the site. While, all this is happening a psychopath (Stephen Rae) is kidnapping girls and torturing them live on the net. So, is there any connection between the two activities? Does this idea ring a bell, it sure does. Flimsy rip-off comes straight to mind while watching this very bland and trashy film, despite director William Malone's best efforts. Elements from other (better) films show up and you just can't deny it or even forgive it for being uninspiring. Though, actually I didn't hate it, but I could've gone without seeing it. The premise starts off pretty interesting, but after that it just fizzles out. It just becomes tiresome and rather dull story telling, with uninspired performances from the leads that aren't capable of carrying a film and are hardly convincing in their roles. The plot doesn't make too much sense, with pointless subplots and no real cohesion. It does get very muddled with its ridiculous outcomes and it focusing on sequences that are full of tedium. When it reaches the pointless ending you'll think why did I bother? Not much of a mystery is achieved as no tension, atmosphere and detail is built. It basically rips off the plot of \"Ringu/The Ring\". Instead of a video it's now a haunted Website. You can also throw in ideas from \"Videodrome\" (the better of the three) into the mix. The script is fairly mortifying, with such trite dialogue coming out of the their mouths. The screenplay is plain unexciting and ineffective. Performances from the likes of Stephen Dorff, Natascha McElhone and Stephen Rae were by the numbers. They were just so uninteresting and unbelievable that you just didn't care for them. Look out for a small cameo from Jeffery Combs (Re-animator and From Beyond). What the film went for was slick visuals, potent camera-work and flashy editing. Visually it was good, though towards the end the whole treatment did kind of get annoying and incredibly repetitious. The look of the film was incredibly dark, with many gloomy sequences involving dimly lit corridors and rooms. Even the sombre mood or fine score couldn't help it raise any chills. The deaths scenes and torture moments are unimaginative and rather tame. It's glossily executed, but illogical and flat sums it up.",

        "rating": "6",
        "review_detail": "This is a very light-hearted production of a lesser-known Rossini comic opera. It is a live performance, with all the drawbacks that that entails - some singers are less audible from certain positions on-stage, but there is a lot of movement, so such a problem tends to be short-lived. The moving about can occasionally get noisy, too - characters stepping on and off the raised stage almost always make a loud thump, perhaps because microphones were located near the front - I seldom noticed it if people were walking around in the background. The sets are a bit goofy, but bright-colored and amusing; the chairs look particularly uncomfortable.For the most part the singing is quite good - Raimondi, who is by far the best actor, has a nice strong voice as Selim, and can sing as fast as anyone. The duet between Selim and Don Geronio in Act II, which culminates in a blistering patter song as the two threaten to murder each other, is the highlight of the opera. Paolo Rumetz is good as Don Geronio, though I think that maybe the role was originally intended for an older man - I get the impression that Geronio and Fiorilla are supposed to be a ridiculous May/December mismatch, with a feeble old man unable to control his young, lively wife. Still, this Geronio may not be old, but he does come across as a perpetually fogged simpleton, yet kind-hearted enough not to lose the audience's sympathy. Cecilia Bartoli is a fine singer, but her Fiorilla seems so much tougher than Geronio that it's hard not to feel sorry for him. I think she might be trying too hard to be brilliant and fascinating - her singing part is a difficult one, so she's got a lot to handle, but her facial contortions can be a bit off-putting. She might have done better just to relax and sing instead of trying to act so much. Reinaldo Macias is not the strongest tenor I've heard, but he's not a bad actor, and he bears an astonishing resemblance to a young Jean-FranÃ§ois Balmer. It's quite delightful to see him simply lapse into bliss every time he catches sight of his own reflection in the polished knob of his fancy walking stick. This is one of those productions one may not want to watch from beginning to end all that often, but it is a lot of fun nevertheless.",

They are great actors and we lap them up on screen. Funny, though, I rented this because Saeed Jaffrey was in it playing \"Billy Fish.\" I enjoyed watching Saeed in the Merchant-Ivory pictures and in the British thriller \"Killing Kind,\" and in the new pyx w/ Burt Reynolds set in Amsterdam called \"Snapshots.\" These guys have such appealing chutzpah together and twinkle along with preposterous schemes and grandiose impulses, and they have a kind of honor about friendship and loyalty. Guided by a lot of luck, they do manage to take over leadership of a small, devout country that accepts the Masonic emblem as proof of Connery's Divinity! What a comedic romp this becomes. And Sean, at first Solomon-like in his wisdom,soon becomes tarnished and, with veiled lasciviousness, decides to wed. That sets off the old Dudes who were the Guiding Gurus before Connery got there. Michael Caine should not have stuck around for the wedding. Caine was ready to split because he couldn't stomach the direction Connery was going in, with the Kingship Routine and the hedonism. But Caine DID stick around and when the wedding day dawned, and when the bride BIT Connery and he BLED, well, the Old Dude Gurus gave the go-ahead for the mob of citizenry to give Connery 'what fer.' And they managed to do this. Caine lived thru it all to come back and regale Kipling (what a terrific, never-before-seen job of underplaying a role Chrisopher Plummer did here - he was simply magnificent and I did not recognize the actor in any way/shape/form as accustomed to him by his later roles)with the entire story. This is an original tale. The photography was luscious. It makes you appreciate John Huston's work all the more. Some movie people you just don't wanna see age. And that applies to Caine, Connery, Huston, Plummer, and certainly not the fine Saheed Jaffrey, whose cultured speaking intonations are thrilling to hear and who has aged to perfection, now around 76. I hope the movie-makers will utilize this gentleman in good roles of grace and meaning until he is too old to memorize dialogue! This is a great film for younger people to go back and see. It will remind them of their own fragile humanity and give them an idea of the passage of time and the parade of viable and gifted humans who inhabit our earth.",

        "rating": "5",
        "review_detail": "\"Into the West\" is a very uneven telling of the story of the American West.I have to give the producers credit. They tried to tell a balanced view of the tale, by including viewpoints of both white settlers and of the dispossessed Indians. It was a noble effort, and very brave.Sadly, they created an inconsistent, oftentimes disappointing, product.The plot line revolving around the Lakota people was brilliant. The tale of young medicine man Loved by the Buffalo is wonderfully done and completely heart-wrenching. There is a high level of authenticity, plausibility, and interest around these Indians and their families. The saga of the Lakota is the shining spot on this miniseries. I didn't find too much fault with any of the Indian segments of this miniseries, they did justice to Black Kettle and Little Bighorn and the Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee, forming a cohesive and emotional story of the various tribes of natives.It's the stories surrounding the white settlers that are horrible.The primary problem is the obvious desire of the filmmakers to include every major event and icon in Western history into five two-hour episodes. They include Jebediah Smith's quest for the California coast. They include Bleeding Kansas. They include wagon trains. They include blasting railroad tunnels. They include the Golden Spike ceremony. They include the Gold Rush. The include the Pony Express. They include practically every event you could think of into these episodes. This required huge contrivances on the part of the writers. They created a huge family from western Virginia, made them all hungry for adventure, and scattered them throughout every major event whether their presence made sense or not. The main character, Jacob Wheeler (horribly played by Matthew Settle in the beginning, better played as \"old Jacob\" by John Terry), manages to not only make it to California but also marries a Lakota woman, has some kids, abandons his family, becomes a mountain man, joins the army and defeats the Mexicans, pans for gold, rejoins his family, has some more kids, and manages to live an unnatural long life ... very little of which is believable.The secondary problem is the writing. So much of the dialogue is contrived and overdone. Because the producers wanted to include every event, all the actors were forced to read long speeches describing what was going on at that time. Plus they embellished it with so many period colloquialisms it would choke an English major. Made the dialogue more distracting than interesting. This was double jeopardy in the first three episodes where Matthew Settle not only delivers bad dialogue on-screen, but also has to read some of the hokeyness via narration (quite possibly the worst use of narration in any film).There's plenty of lousy acting to be had. The worst by far is the aforementioned Matthew Settle, but there are so many I couldn't possibly count all the bad performances. Again, with dialogue and choices as bad as those mentioned earlier, not too many actors could have pulled it off.Towards the end there is some redemption for this series. The fourth episode, focusing on the Black Kettle massacre, the battle of Little Bighorn, and a moving piece on the forced \"assimilation\" of Indian children into American society, provides some relief from the vapidity of the prior three. And the last episode, focusing on the Ghost Dance and the Wounded Knee massacre, is actually pretty good (until Jacob Wheeler's reappearance to give the stereotypical \"high concept wrap-up\"). So it's not a total loss.But overall they could of, and should of, done a much better job on this miniseries. Thanks to some bad choices this series didn't have a chance, and it really deserved one. I am still convinced the story of the settlement of the West is a story with all the elements of great drama. But with such a bad treatment it'll be some time before anyone attempts to tell it again.5 out of 10.Barky",

Lemmon can dance, but Matthau cannot, and one scene has Lemmon trying to teach Matthau, only to be caught by Donald O'Connor and Hal Linden dancing together (O'Connor and Linden jumping to the wrong conclusion). If they can't pull their weight as social dancers, they will have to pay the $1,500.00 per person fare as travelers. Neither can afford that. Matthau really could not care much about this - he hopes that he will be lucky to find, romance, and marry a wealthy woman. Lemmon is encouraged to do the same, but he is not as mercenary. As it turns out Lemmon does meet Gloria De Haven, and Matthau meets Dyan Cannon (and her mother, Elaine Stritch). But the course to true love is never smooth in movies. Matthau has a rival for Cannon, in Edward Mulhare. And Brent Spiner, the cruise entertainment director, is an evil martinet determined to impress the cruise line owner (Rue McLanahan) to put him in control of all the cruise ship's entertainment centers.It is a well-cast film, which helps (this is reminiscent of the two \"Grumpies\" films that preceded it. But those films had better balance to them. They had moments of pathos where one could see Lemmon and Matthau were not just funny men but human types. Here Lemmon is shown to have such a weakness - he has romanced De Haven in spite of his qualms, but at a critical point remembers his deep love for his first wife. But Matthau's personality is so mercenary (a \"cousin\" to his \"Whiplash Willie Gingrich\" in THE FORTUNE COOKIE), that his turning into a legitimate lover of Cannon doesn't quite sit well. Nor does it sit well when we find other likable characters can be equally mercenary.However there are plenty of great moments in the film. Spiner's unplanned involvement with a colorful local parade is one. So is Matthau's ridiculous dance with Rue McLanahan that looks atrocious (he calls his non-steps, \"the crawl\")but that she enjoys. Spiner, better known as \"Mr. Data\" the android in STAR TREK, THE NEXT GENERATION, turns in a fine comic villain performance. My only criticism is that Linden and O'Connor seem too peripheral in the plot (although both do give filler about the ruthlessness of Spiner, whom Linden really dislikes). But the film is still very amusing, and worth while seeing. Unfortunately it was not their final film. That would be THE ODD COUPLE II.",

He is THE hottest person that ever walked this planet!!!! So many people think that he is really hot too. I think that without his long hair he would not be as hot. So if Justin Chatwin ever reads this...keep your long hair!I know he wont ever read this but that would be good if he does. I love him SO much.

This is a character and film with a lot of hate. Some consider Bickle to be a loner, but sometimes he appears to be a man with a lot hatred to his surroundings. Could it be a political or social statement by Scorsese? Or perhaps that Paul Schrader was going through depression when he wrote the script? Whatever the answer might be, all I can say is that this is a very powerful film. If you are like me when this film is over your mouth will be wide open. Bickle (in a perfect performance by Robert De Niro) is a scary character. Although his motives are positive (sometimes) the way he gets results is a little extreme. Then again it was the '70s. I'm sure there's a lot of Travis Bickles out there. And they would probably love this movie as much as I do.RATING: 4 STARS (****) The film is a little too dark, but in a way thats why it's so awesome!",

It also dealt with two beautiful women. \"Persona\" is a film that kept me glued to the screen. It has to be Ingmar Bergman's best film. I'm not just saying that because every critic has said that since the mid sixties. I'm saying that because it is a surreal mind puzzle that made me dive into my subconscious. \"Persona\" is filmed in gorgeous black and white and at an 85 minute running time it never wears out it's welcome. The montage in the beginning is sooooooooo bizarre, don't sit to close to the screen you might hallucinate. The story concerns Alma (Bibi Anderson), a nurse who is taking care of Elizabeth, played mysteriously by the sexy Liv Ullman. Elisabeth refuses to speak, she stopped talking in the middle of a play. For some reason Alma feels very comfortable around her and starts to tell her personal things. She even moves in with Elisabeth to help out. Alma explicitly talks about a sexual escapade that her and her friend experienced on the beach. The scene shows nothing sexual, but the vivid language and sexy Swedish dialog turns this moment into one of the hottest most arousing scenes in cinema history. (something almost popped up for me... spring-boing!!!) Elisabeth still remains silent. There characters eventually merge as one person. Alma also finds out that Elisabeth has betrayed her when she reads a letter she wrote telling a friend about her personal intimate secrets. Oh no! This is when the film turns into a crazed decent into madness as only Bergman could bring you. He even films one scene twice but at a different angle. Now if only Bergman was more optimistic; poor guy. All kidding aside, Persona is an amazing experience that breaks the fourth wall between film and reality. Images are only representational of life, Bergman shows viewers this as the camera runs out of film. This is just my interpretation. Oh heck, I think I'll have two watch this a couple more times, and not just for the explicit conversation about Alma's orgasms. I think both \"Persona\" and \"Muholland Drive\" would make a great double feature. I don't think there is any film that is like \"Persona\". In fact there probably never will be.

        "review_detail": "If you are going to see this movie and looking for a recreation of \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" then stop now. Time Burton phenomenally directs this movie with amazing sets and design. The world of the chocolate factory is breath-taking. The amazing contrast between the drab city and the vibrant factory is one of the many stunning visual effects.The children in this movie are back with just as terrible, if not more so, personalities. Charlie is also extremely well played and fully portrays the Charlie from before.The main difference in Tim Burton's version is Depp's idea of Wonka. Wilder makes Wonka out to be a cynical and tormented man. Depp describes Wonka as a child who only grew in physical size. He constantly swings from a serious tone to bitterly sarcastic to completely delusional. His character mirrors that of a child forced to live as an adult. Many people have compared this portrayal of Wonka to Michael Jackson. This comparison has some merit as both seem to be trapped in their childhood, but this does not demerit the performance at all. Just because such a likeness exist does not mean the Willy Wonka should not have been played as such.Tim Burton also fleshes out the movie by adding the background of Wonka and a short segment about the history behind the Oompa Loompas. Wonka's twisted beginnings truly demonstrate why he has turned into such a clash between childhood and adulthood.Another addition of Tim Burton are the new songs for the Oompa Loompas. Instead of the stagnant tunes from \"Willy Wonka and the Chocalate Factory\", multiple short songs from various genres are played. All completely choreographed to fit with the genre, these scenes are a great laugh for those who have seen the original.*SPOILIER START* Tim Burton even injects a very funny exchange of dialogue criticizing who the dance and song by the Oompa Loompas seems setup and planned.*SPOILER END*This movie is an excellent view and I completely recommend seeing it. It provides a much fuller movie experience and covers the background and explains the future of Charlie; this is a large bonus as the original lacked any background or future. If I could I would give the movie 9.5 out of 10 because there were only a few points where the movie could have been slightly tweaked. The scene where Charly brings home the ticket just seemed to have some awkward dialogue. But by these ratings I will give it a 9, because 10 is reserved for perfection.To reiterate, this movie is a great new experience even for those who have seen the original. But if you are just looking for a new version with revamped visuals, don't waste your money. Compared to the original, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is an amazing experience, surpassing the original as an entire movie.",

This is partly because it still pokes fun at those people you should be accepting, but mostly because it has a big, big heart.I'm not a soppy person by nature, but I really loved this movie. It shone out like a gem in a sea of recent dross. I liked the fact that despite his flaws, Hal was a decent guy, and his actions in the children's hospital the final time only served to prove it.If there was one thing that did somewhat undermine its ultimate moral, it was the fact that the big gal who is the object o Hal's affections, is in fact played by stick-insect Paltrow in a fat suit. Made in America; a country where gross obesity seems to be a national pass-time, I find it impossible to believe that they couldn't find a suitable actress. Perhaps, despite the upbeat message of acceptance, the Farrely's thought that audiences couldn't stomach a genuine fat person in a the romantic lead? I'd like to think it was more because they didn't want to poke that much fun at a genuinely big girl, but I somehow doubt it...This is a movie to live your life by.",

These characters are all far from perfect, but then they never act so imperfect that they become imperfections or social outcasts - it was a fine line, I sat dreading and hoping bad things weren't about to happen. The characters are disconnected, and oddly intertwined. This film felt like a guilty pleasure and sitting next to my wife who didn't laugh once made me feel all the more guilty. What punctuates these uncomfortable moments with the kid's scenes are the adult's scenes - - these adults seem more like children. In fact, the naivetÃ© of these adults is really a welcoming thing in this day and age of children growing up so soon. The adults view of the world reminds me of how David Byrne (of Talking Heads/True Stories) perceives the world - \"pieces and parts\" of interest, focusing on minutiae and the everyday \"stuff\", showing the absurd in the ordinary, while never condescending to any character.

I mean, it's not a magnum opus, maybe a little creepy when you come to think of the concept - but the characterization and acting by the leads was just brilliant! Everything was so well crafted that you will exit from the movie theater with a smile. Unless you're weirder than weird, of course.While watching the movie, so many questions arose - Why a Scotsman (McGregor) is made to speak with an American accent? Why is he paired with a lady (Johannsen) 10 years younger to him. Guess what - even these silliest of answers get answered in the end! PROLOGUE: This is not a SPOILER. It's an explanation of how things are before the time-line of the movie begins. The setting is 2019. People have gotten richer, of course technology has advanced drastically, and the concept of cloning does exist. Noted celebrities, politicians, sports-persons desire to live a longer life and a career no matter what has to be done. Thus, there are clones created in a remote institute in Arizona run by an English scientist ,Merrick. Merrick and his staff basically take a complete scan of the client (called the \"investor\") and a clone of the same investor is created with the same physical and anatomical, yet closer to perfect, features. However, these clones, or \"insurance policies\" as they are called, are bred to only be killed eventually for their spare parts - lungs, heart, you name it, to be taken away and given to the investor to live longer. Until their termination time, they are fed on a very strict diet, and are only educated up to the level of a 15 year old. The clones are kept content in their inner lives by being told they were brought to the institute because they were \"contaminated\" in the real world and were getting cured from the same. They were also promised a lottery where a winner gets to go to the \"Island\" - where a new world is set to begin, new breeding, no pollution, etc. This is until a flaw occurs in the habilitation process and one product, Lincoln has questions....----------------------------- Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen were absolutely brilliant in their acting and carried the movie from beginning to the end. I was slightly disappointed when I saw the trailer earlier, and it implied that Scarlett was becoming a blonde bimbo of Hollywood - but I was wrong. She not only had a role to play, but played it well. Hope she becomes the next Hollywood superstar as she is a truly good actress, and charming in her own way.McGregor, on the other hand, carries his post-Star_Wars grace very well, and should be looking for some really dramatic and challenging roles in the near future to get an Oscar or some awards. He is a good actor, and is definitely no James Bond material - too down to earth as an actor (maybe not as a person) to play the cocky British spy. The supporting cast - Michael Clarke Duncan only had a few lines to spare and was a cry baby, but an OK role done. Djimon Honsou - Hollywood's only \"African\" actor played his role well and gracefully. Steve Buscemi is what one could call a struggling actor. I respect him for trying something new like playing a confused ex-con on a full season of the SOPRANOS - showed his less-comedy side which he portrays in Adam Sandler movies. In the Island, he did sort of fit the role of a crazy techie, but he needs to find something that will bring his recognition back up.Sean Bean, the smooth talking, English villain who played a James Bond baddie too early in his career, also carried his vicious role well. Would have been more appropriate to see an American Southerner play the role of the institute's head-honcho as it was set in Arizona. Overall I gave the movie 8/10. I prefer it to Minority Report, and thank God it was not too hyped!",

I say probably because there is considerable debate over him to this day.If you love democracy, with a balance of power approach as in the Federal Constitution (or the states for that matter) Long is an evil aberration. He used the normal methods of rising up the political ladder as a state railway commissioner, a state senator, Governor, and U.S. Senator. On his way up he found ways of reducing the opposition to a set of shrill, impotent voices, and of manipulating the state legislature, the judiciary, and the local governments to do what he wanted. For all intents and purposes Louisiana was a dictatorship under Huey. And once he got into the U.S. Senate, he planned to spread his influence until he was in the White House, and could do the same thing there.Therefore, his death by gunshot in the state capital building at Baton Rouge, La. on September 18, 1935, was a lucky break. Whether he was shot by Dr. Carl Austin Weiss (the son-in-law of an opponent who'd been racially smeared by Long) or by a trigger happy guard who was joining in the shooting of Weiss does not matter - he would have been bad news for American Democracy.But here's the problem. Huey did not come from a state that had a history of two party democracy. Most of the states in the south were dominated for decades by the Democratic Party (which was opposed to big business in theory, but also highly racist towards African-Americans and minorities). So when he studied how to get higher in office, he learned how his predecessors did it. He also noted the success of others in other states at turning them into fiefdoms - like Senator Hiram Johnson of California. Secondly, although his methods were crude and resembled fascist or communist models, Huey actually did do a lot of good for his state. One has to study the man's career in light of previous Democrats who were elected to public office. Huey came from the parishes - the back country, and knew the needs of the farmers (both white, Cajun, and black), and how they were neglected in favor of the large cities, particularly New Orleans and Baton Rouge. He was smart, and managed to get a college education, and eventually became a lawyer (a very good one - he actually argued before the U.S. Supreme Court). The Governors and the legislators and the judiciary were extremely conservative (the popular term in use was \"Bourbons\"). Huey, as he built up his machine, delivered services, such as roads and highways and power, to the countryside. He also improved school conditions for the countryside. While still willing to use racial slurs (as with Dr. Weiss's father-in-law) Huey actually got more jobs going for the African-American community. He could also display anti-Semitism when he wished, but when someone pointed out that when he did that he resembled Hitler, Huey became furious: \"Don't ever compare me to that son-of-a-bitch!\", he yelled, \"Every fool whose ever gone against those people has wrecked his state's economy!!\" Not a comment of love, but obviously of sense.Huey was an opportunist. To raise revenues in Louisiana he invited Lucky Luciano to install one armed bandits throughout the state. But he also could sacrifice for reasonable grounds. He signed a law reducing the cotton production from Louisiana to build up prices for the cotton outside the state.So he is not an easy figure to totally condemn or admire. Ken Burns documentary on \"the Kingfish\" (Huey used that name, based on a character on the radio show AMOS AND ANDY, for himself) gives a fairly good balanced view. Burns shows what was frighteningly close to happening, but he does show that Huey was more than a power seeker or a buffoon (as some enemies suggested). While not as detailed as the Burns documentaries on THE CIVIL WAR, JAZZ, or BASEBALL, it is a good place to start studying this remarkable political career.",

You take away the love story, and you will see a very accurate portrayal of an very tragic event.There are some scenes that will break everyone's heart. One is the old couple waiting to die in their bed as their room is being consumed by water. Another is the string quartet playing music while death and destruction surround them. The scene that really wrenches my gut is when the captain commits suicide. I find these scenes very emotional mainly because they probably actually happened.Is the love story really corny? You bet. But many films such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", \"The English Patient\", and even \"Lord of the Rings\" have lot of silly sentimental corny love story lines but they are much more acclaimed than Titanic. I have a feeling the reason why this film got so much bad rap is that much of the audience are very young females and that their being head-over-heels over DiCaprio annoyed lot of men. (I think DiCaprio DID do a mediocre performance in this movie.) But the silly love story in my mind didn't affect the emotionally devastating impact I had watching the powerful sequences of death and dying. \"Saving Private Ryan\" is the only other film that affected me more than \"Titanic\" in showing the horror of human beings struggling to survive.",

Its usually a nice break from all the dramatic movies. But I have to say this was a total disaster. The film is filled with songs... at least 6-7 of them, almost never allowing the movie to ever maintain a flow. The storyline of the movie is pretty decent but a lot more could have been done with it to make the movie a whole lot better. Most of the movie was a drag, specially the second half. Sushmita Sen has done a great job and looks good as always, Salman Khan is getting pretty good at comedy, and Arshad Varsi is hilarious as usual. But barring maybe 25-30 minutes of funny original scenes, the movie is mostly a big waste of time. I would recommend to definitely wait till the DVD is released for watching the film. It might be just a little more enjoyable.It is probably not the WORST David Dhawan flick, but a BAD one.",

Casting was excellent; Michael Caine as Alfred was inspired, and he plays the part both with charismatic charm and with a deep empathy for Bruce Wayne and his demons. I didn't check out the cast list fully before seeing the movie, and I kept telling myself that the actor playing the young James Gordon looked really familiar... has Gary Oldman ever played a good guy before this? Hopefully they will continue to use him in the sequels (of course there will be those!) so we can see his eventual rise to police commissioner.It was great to see how human the man behind the mask is... that is something that Val Kilmer and George Clooney could not come across with (Michael Keaton did a better job of portraying Bruce Wayne as a tortured soul, but not was well as Bale did).And while I'm not a Bat addict, wasn't one of the villains named \"Scarecrow\" in the comic?

Before long I suspected that Conan Doyle had no connection with this story, apart from the name of the main characters, and from then on it became a game of 'spot the anachronisms', of which there were too many to count. Rupert Everett was okay, I suppose, but the splendid Ian Hart was completely wasted in this production. So unlike the dynamic partnership between Holmes and Waterson in 'Baskervilles'. By the time the story had dribbled to its silly conclusion, I had become convinced that it had originated from a recently written screenplay, so I scrutinised the credits, beginning and end, for any sign of 'Conan Doyle'. No, nothing. Not even a 'Based on characters created by'. I'm surprised that the script was written by the man who did the screenplay for 'Baskervilles'. I would have thought he would have realised that aristocratic girls back then did not 'pass out' but rather fainted. Very disappointing indeed. Please, BBC, don't continue down this road!",

Stepfanie Kramer was holding a very narrow lead for NBC when Mark Harmon buried the competition while swimming the third leg. Victory easily went to NBC in this event.Next up was the kayak race. Tony Danza (ABC Team) lost control of his kayak and went sideways, partially entering the CBS lane. He caused his team to fall quite a bit behind. Luckily, Tracy Scoggins kicked some major butt in the third leg and drove her team to an exciting come from behind victory. The CBS team was a poor sport about the whole thing and actually protested (even though their loss had nothing to do with the Danza fiasco). Sore losers...ABC wins this event.In this part of the broadcast Cosell tactfully interviews Tracy Scoggins and asks her if she is bothered by the fact that people consider her \"just a sexpot; no talent\". Good job for keeping things light Howie! The only full game showed in the football event was the final. NBC won in a very dull game 9-5. Mr. Cosell opened up his big mouth again when Jennifer O'Neill was injured in a qualifying match. He stated that everyone is familiar with the problems that she has endured over the years. However, \"in good taste does not want to discuss them in detail\". That's you Howie...a really classy guy brimming with good taste!Baseball dunk was next and Tony Lo Bianco's 3-for-3 performance led ABC to victory. Branda Vaccaro, noticeably absent from other events, took what seemed like a million years to get herself seated in the dunk tank. Everyone found it hilarious. Hmmm.The obstacle course was highlighted by Tracy Scoggins defeating Kim Fields twice and Harmon dominating the men's side of things. He easily defeated a klutzy Tony Danza in the final (he messed up twice).The tandem bicycle relay had NBC and ABC battling it out. That is until Tony Lo Bianco lost his footing and Mark Harmon (with Jane Badler) showed his athletic prowess yet again. Another event won by NBC.That set up a disappointing Tug of War final between NBC and ABC. It lasted under a minute and was predictably dominated by NBC. So there you have it. NBC won the 17th BOTNS with ABC coming in second and CBS embarrassing itself by failing to win even one event.",

That being said, I must say that I enjoyed \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" twice as much as the 1971 version. To begin with, the current version is more visually appealing. The sets were bright and colorful, and more in line with what you might expect from a reclusive genius' workplace. I loved the back story explaining Willy's great love for chocolate and why he was so determined to make it big in the chocolate business. But all of that would be meaningless if the acting was less than great. Fortunately, all of the performances were tremendous!!!! No kidding!!!! Every single one, from Charlie's bed-ridden grandparents to the chocolate master himself. Most notably, Freddie Highmore was cute as a button from his mud spattered high-water pants to his adorable dimpled cheeks. He brought a purity and innocence to his role that was very genuine. All of the other kids were deliciously annoying, as were their parents, which made you realize why the kids were so disgustingly bratty. The oompa-loompas were a scream, and I thought replicating one person to portray lots of oompa-loompas was a very clever and creative touch. The musical numbers were hilarious, without the in your face moralism of the 1971 variety. But I save my greatest praise for Willy Wonka himself, the truly great Johnny Depp. I know he seemed a little creepy, but wouldn't anyone be after being alone in a chocolate factory for 15 years with nothing but oompa-loompas for company?!!? Johnny Depp provided just the right amount of weirdness and sensitivity to the role and has proved himself again to be one of the greatest actors of our time. Mr. Depp never disappoints!!! This movie was a treat for so many reasons. I was very happy to see that Tim Burton toned down the tunnel ride. Fans of the '71 version will know what I mean. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was pure pleasure from beginning to end! I will see it again in the theater and be the first in line to purchase the DVD!!! Excellent movie, all the way around!!!",

Listen to the narrator in the prologue as he tells of the history of the ring and Gollum. That alone is so much more poignant and emotional than 99% of the acting,and I use the term loosely for Liv Tyler and Sean Astin, etc., in the Jackson films.(Which I did like, by the way, I just didn't love those films)John Hurt is great as Aragorn, as are the other voices, and the animation, though extraordinarily trippy, creates a dark foreboding mood.One of the most important differences between the films as well, is that in the Bakshi version Gandalf is portrayed as wise, cunning, and almost having an incredible influence and hand in all of the actions of Middle Earth. The Gandalf in the Jackson films, though played by an excellent actor in Ian Mckellan was cast as a dottering old man who bumped into things and did not have the foresight and all encompassing breadth of vision that the Bakshi Gandalf did.Also, the Balrog in the Bakshi and Jackson versions serves as a microcosm of why the Bakshi version works on a more mystical level. In the Jackson version, the Balrog looks like a CGI ridden, no personality, bull faced, not realistic thing from a Godzilla movie. The one in the Bakshi version, though not as done with effects, has much more of a depth of character, and it exists as a realistic villain rather than Gigan, Mothra, etc.The score in the Bakshi version is infinitely superior to the Enyaesque stylings of Jackson. I mean, when you are watching the Bakshi version the score sways and segways the film, whereas the feeling during the Jackson films is; okay I am sitting in a theater watching this,and now they are playing Enya over it.All in all, despite the MANY things Jackson got right, and the many things he got wrong, the Bakshi version succeeds where the Jackson version does not in the most important and, in the end, vital way. It has MAGIC.",

Wilson's character seems the more typical, with Vaughn having more original bits to his character. As others have said, Vaughn's performance is not to be missed. The constant analysis of situations with reference to the \"rules\" is funny in part because of the truth contained in them and the perceptiveness of the characters, even though their goals are superficial.The supporting cast is great. It has been said before, but \"when Christopher Walken is the most sane character . . . .\" The younger sister and the brother are scene stealers. The interplay between the younger brother and the Vaughn is original and sidesplitting.Overall lots of fun. Worth the price of admission. Vince Vaughn deserved lots of attention before, for comedy and drama. This movie will establish him as a comedic star to look forward to.",

        "review_detail": "Despite it's grand name, Halls of Montezuma is a small war film. What I mean is that the movie focuses more on a small group of men and their fears and problems than it does on a grand plan for Allied victory. It's a very personal movie. We get to see these men up-close and we begin to develop feelings for them. I wouldn't doubt that this is one of the first films to show a U.S. Lieutenant so battle scarred that he resorts to using pain killers just to function. Unlike other war films of this era, not all of these men are going to make it to the end. War is like that. It doesn't pick and chose people to live because we like them. So in that regard, it's also more realistic than some other war movies made in the 50s.To succeed as a small, personal war movie as I've described, the cast has to be able to act. This cast does not disappoint. Richard Widmark, Jack Webb, and Karl Malden are all excellent in their respective roles. I was especially impressed with Webb who has an acting style that can grate on the nerves. He's more subdued here and it works. But as good as these three are, Jack Palance is the highlight of the movie for me. He was undoubtedly the most believable. I could really picture him doing the things in real life that were called for in the script.I have no difficulty recommending Halls of Montezuma to fans of war films. It's a very welcome addition to my DVD collection.",

        "review_detail": "Steven Spielberg's third 'from out of this world' opus is just one big mess. It's difficult to understand how the man who gave us the charm of E.T. and the humanity of Close Encounters could deliver such pathetic junk. The biggest problem in this film is a script so lacking in coherency that it's writing seems better suited to one of those bad 50's B sci-fi movies. (I think I just heard H. G. Wells roll around in his grave for the umpteenth time.)The other big problem is the lack of empathy one feels for the characters. Cruise's daughter is so annoying I almost wished one of the tripods would put that screeching presence out of her misery. And what's with Tim Robbins? His hammy performance was the only true bit of humor to be found anywhere.Granted, the special effects are great and one should not expect any big statement on the human condition from big budget sci-fi, but we're talking Spielberg here. One anticipates not only a good show but a superior narrative from a good storyteller. On the positive side, the director goes for a much grittier look (a la Saving Private Ryan) which is appropriate for the subject matter. However, maybe the movie would have worked better had it expanded the story to involve more characters and encompassed more the broader effect of the invasion outside of Cruise's family.All in all, a total waste of talent and an even clunkier mess than the marauding invading aliens.",

Both actors give good performances, as the good side of the track students, who try to give Arnie the support he needs, to overcome the teenage obstacles that have embraced him.Well, that only goes so far, so Arnie finds solace in Christine , a 1958 Plymouth Fury, which plays 1950's music to display its' feelings of the moment...interesting.As the plot goes , the Bullies get more abrasive and attack Christine at will,at the shop where Arnie restored Christine to its' glory days..Arnie and Christine develop a \"Special \" relationship, and they almost become one in thought !So the haunted car goes on the Attack , getting Arnie the Revenge he was seeking. Sort of interesting, could have used a better music score. His friends see Arnie becoming more distant and try to bring him back to reality. Anyway, if you are looking for a ghostly movie with teenagers of angst, then this movie is for you .This movie rates 7 of 10 , see with a double feature with \"Fright Night\" . more teenagers , more angst, a lot of fun !!!",

This film showed it motionless, then suddenly cracks go up the side and it collapses.That's just the beginning of such horrid scientific inaccuracies, that the scientists I read after this movie came out were right: this is not even science fiction, it's science fantasy.I'm sure seismologists WISH we could just watch a monitor that shows the magnitude on the Richter scale WHILE IT'S HAPPENING!

        "review_detail": "What is it that makes a great horror movie? There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it can't be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter doesn't know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it's still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he's just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.",

They say that comedy is harder than drama. How about a combination of comedy and drama that really works? How about such a combination, where the lead characters are not very attractive? Giamatti is excellent, but so is Clark. Lots of acting with little glances and subtle body movements. Madsen is perfectly cast and her character well-played. Many find that the interaction between Miles and Maya is not credible. It seems to me that Maya and Miles are both more than deep enough for this to resemble real life more than the movies.This may not be the most profound movie ever made, and it may not advance movie-making on a technical or technique level, but this is a very good film, all around.",

        "review_detail": "Controversy seems to have greeted this documentary everywhere it has screened, and its selection for the Melbourne International Film Festival was no exception. I had to run the gauntlet of a bunch of bleating, ill-informed animal activists who were making false claims that the organisers of the film festival were supporting a 'cat snuff film'. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is NOT a 'cat snuff film' - such claims would be laughable if they were not completely ridiculous and untrue.I find such premature condemnation irritating in the extreme. It is as clear as there is a nose of your face that the people so strongly opposed to this documentary have not a single clue as to what it actually contains. It does NOT contain the graphic components of the cat killing film in question. It does feature, however, a detailed and confronting written description of the film's content, by way of a written scroll giving a minute-by-minute description of its content. The audience is thankfully spared the real footage of the crime.Casuistry: The Art of Killing a Cat is a documentary, pure and simple - and I found it a very well balanced and objective one for that matter. It was very thought provoking. It features interviews with the cat killing criminals, as well as animal activists and an investigating policeman, among many others. It also highlights the killer's defence that it was some sort of 'work of art', especially given that one of them had previously made other films depicting animal cruelty in the name of 'art'.There is some footage of one of the killer's earlier film 'art' works, including dancing with the corpse of a pig obtained from an abattoir, and a peculiar music video featuring dancing skinned animals from a research laboratory. Perhaps the most confronting was the short depiction of the beheading of a small live chicken. All of this imagery was presented in context, and was neither condoning the acts, nor suggestive of such inclusions as being some form of entertainment. It was featured in this documentary to balance out the killer's argument that the filming of the cat's torture was not a precedent setter, but one that had occurred within the context of his previous 'art works' - a nonsense argument in my opinion.As a viewer, I was left feeling a sense of scorn and pity upon the perpetrators of this act - one of whom seemed to frequent minimise the severity of it, with lines of argument such as: \"well, we were drugged out\" and \"we kill animals for meat, so what's the problem\". They seemed mainly well spoken and articulate individuals, but ones that seemed to lack a sense of morality, consequence, responsibility and a honed capacity for knowing when to draw the line with certain reasonable or acceptable behaviours. I think most reasonable adults would agree that the deliberate infliction of real pain on human or animal, regardless of intent, is a tad bit intolerable.Speaking of what is intolerable, the session I attended contained a hefty presence of police and security personnel, after the cinema received some veiled threats. If animal activists think that threatening innocent cinema-goers - who are merely exercising their right to see what they wish - somehow increases the validity of their arguments, then they are sorely misguided and utterly deluded.",

You might be tempted to walk out in the first 20 minutes, which seem artless and aimless: not very fascinating people making not very fascinating small talk in drab settings. The by-default protagonist, Marnie (Kate Dollenmayer), is a listless 23-year-old between jobs and quietly smitten with an old friend, Alex (Christian Rudder), who has just broken up with his girlfriend. Does Alex like her? Other friends, among them Alex's sister, don't quite know. Alex, it seems, doesn't quite know. Marnie doesn't communicate her affections very forcefully. In fact, she does nothing very forcefully. She drinks a little at parties, she lies around, she hangs out with laid-back friends, and she floats.Floating, indecision, the indefinite: This is the gray arena of Funny Ha Ha. The surprise is how the movie comes together and gets under your skin before you even know why you should give a damn. What seems improvised and random turns out to be controlled, at times cunningly shaped, and the surface of nonsequiturs and random shrugs conceals fairly intense emotionsÂ—the emotions of self-consciously cool, easy, inarticulate people afraid to pin anything down. The nonaction is set (in what appears to be Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville) in midsummer and has a midsummer formlessnessÂ—an extension of the kind of languor you feel in those hazy dog days before the sudden hardness and definition of fall.Dollenmayer becomes more and more fun to read. A young woman with long limbs and sleepy eyes on a big, open face, she's just the sort of beauty whose self-effacing vibe would make her less than magnetic to really handsome guys and madly irresistible to nerdsÂ—who think that maybe, just maybe, they'd have a shot. The one she attracts is played by the director, who makes himself look very unprepossessing, indeed. In fact, he's cringe-worthy. The character he plays, Mitchell, tries to make a virtue of his self-deprecation: Loathing himself is obviously all he has to think about. He's so unappealing that it really would be a sign of self-disrespect for Marnie to go to bed with him. Fortunately, he's too lame even to press his case. But she'd be no better off with adorable Alex, whose boneless diffidence seems increasingly selfish and calculated.Funny Ha Ha is a bit of a stunt. How can intelligent people, even slackers, be this vaporous? No one talks about life, the world, politics, music, moviesÂ—anything concrete. But out of this vaporousness, and within the narrow parameters he has set, Bujalski has made an indelible film...by David Edelstein, Slate.com",

It was much more balanced, non-judgmental and rational than it could have been and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The performances in the movie are good. Sharon Lawrence provides an excellent portrayal of the elder woman and gives her character a unique amount of personality, depth and insight which allows the viewer to feel empathy and perhaps in some cases some sympathy for her point of view and the emotions she is going through. She is also exceedingly beautiful and vivacious and that also gives a realistic dimension to this role. Brian Austin Green is also excellent in the role of Paul â€“he gives the character enough passion, sensitivity and realism to make you also relate and identify with the feelings and emotions that he is experiencing. The supporting cast is also excellent â€“with John Getz, Ashleigh Aston Moore and Katie Wright all portraying their characters exceptionally and with perfection. The only disappointing character in my opinion was the character of Paul's mother â€“somehow her character seemed a bit too flat and one-dimensional. Perhaps this was biased by the fact that I didn't like her character but I still think she could have been handled better The script and dialogue in this movie flow well and avoids the trap evident in a considerable number of telemovies of becoming too clichÃ©d or unrealistic. The issues involved in the movie are discussed and treated in a professional way and the consequences of the actions of all the characters involved are evaluated thoughtfully. I actually sympathized with the teenager and Sharon Lawrence's character here â€“being attracted to older woman myself â€“but the movie was wonderful at allowing me to see the other side of the picture. That's what I enjoyed so much about this movie â€“it didn't seek to pass judgment or editorialize about the actions of the main characters. It just let the story unfold quite close to the way that it probably would have in real life.I was disappointed with the ending of this film â€“which I won't reveal-but, like an early reviewer here, I agree that many would see it as a logical conclusion. I'm actually going to give this 9/10 â€“I found this enjoyable, entertaining and intriguing to watch and it totally exceeded my expectations",

        "review_detail": "Today's idea of \"cool\" just did not apply in 1929. It's not at all like a modern movie. It has title screens and actors using overly broad gestures and overacting in a nearly comical manner. They also sing in an artificial stylized semi-operatic manner. It combines the style of a silent movie with a stage production of an operetta. It is obviously from another age, but it only takes a few minutes before you accept the strange style and simply relax and enjoy it. The available DVD was obviously made from a print that came from barely salvageable deteriorating celluloid. The video quality is terrible and the sound quality is merely bad. In spite of all these problems, the movie is worth watching over and over. The comic scenes are amusing. The bad editing and overdrawn acting is mildly amusing, too. The music is fabulous and you soon relax and begin to love wallowing in the corn. The plot? Think of it as \"Zorro goes to Morocco\" and it was probably at least some of the inspiration for Superman (hero with a secret identity who wears a red cape, etc.). The 1953 version is more easily available, but much of the music and plot was gutted to try to make it a bit more \"cool\" in 1950's terms. Unfortunately, the sacrifices removed much of what made the original production work musically and emotionally. I prefer the older version and just wish there was a better print available. If you have any interest in classic operetta, this is a \"do not miss\" film. If you have no feeling for such music, you would probably find this a complete waste of time (and earn my sympathy for your inability to appreciate it).",

I am no big Cher fan, as applies to her acting, but in my opinion it was her best performance ever. Same with Eric Stoltz (Rocky). Stoltz has been doing his thing for 30 years and I have never seen one of his characters that wasn't believable. The guy is \"uber-talented\" and a true professional. This was tough role. He didn't act from *behind* the mask - he had to act *through* the mask. That requires acting at another level of complexity.Sam Elliot (Gar) was believable for me as Cher's (Florence's)love interest and a biker leader. Some may say that all that biker stuff was over the top. I found it convincing. Bikers can seize on a cause with the jaws of a pit bull and be relentless in their support. This was, to me, a really believable situation.The Diana character (Laura Dern) was very welcome and sweet, but I do have a hard time believing that she had not been exposed to some of the concepts that Rocky worked on with her (colors and shapes). She came across as too smart for this stuff to have been a new concept, especially after seeing her parents, who did not seem to be idiots. At the same time, the parents were TOTALLY unbelievable characters. Their daughter, who they obviously love, has a disability, but they are totally repulsed by Rocky and his. It rarely works this way in real life.I do have to sum up with this: If at the end of the movie you did not cry - with real, liquid tears that you could feel with your hand, then you need to call the police right now and turn yourself in as at least a potential (if not actual) serial killer. Just sit on the steps of the front porch and wait for them to get there. Unless you're a certified something-or-other, is simply NOT POSSIBLE to watch the whole movie, and see the ending scene where Cher comes into Rocky's room after finding out he wasn't at school, and not get swept up into that emotion.",

Still, some of the set pieces are quite amusing, the one featuring Marie Dressler (who looks like a cross between Mrs. Potato Head and Fatty Arbuckle in drag here) getting tipsy on a sip of alcohol, the movie within a movie and the spoof of exhibition dancing being among the highlights. Although modern viewers may come to this film expecting it to be a Chaplin feature (who atypically plays a villain), it is in fact very much Marie Dressler's filmÂ—most of the film's comedy comes from watching the sometimes aggravating but essentially innocent Tillie flailing about like a giant, goggle eyed baby as she tries to cope with her unscrupulous gigolo lover and life in the big city. The film also does a sly take on that hoary leftover Victorian clichÃ©, the distant wealthy uncle who conveniently dies: here the uncle rather inconveniently comes back to life (\"not so darn dead after all\" as a title card dryly observes). The film also features Mabel Normand as Chaplins' moll girlfriend (her petite beauty makes her a good foil for Dressler), and the Keystone Cops.",

        "review_detail": "I knew the reviews on this flick were going to be split 50/50 love/hate. So I'll try to stick one in the middle.For lovers of the original, do not go into this movie expecting the Wilder version. You WILL be disappointed. The similarities will make you expect the same warm feelings, but for some reason, you might leave the theater cold, and maybe angry.It was a colorful film, and there was some good acting, but the menacing, mysterious Wonka is definitely missing. Maybe it wasn't Depp's fault, but with the combination of makeup, script, and character development, we end up with what everyone else is calling a androgynous Jacko-Wonka. Depp doesn't have that semi-psychotic explosiveness that Wilder's Wonka had. Depp's character is more true to the book, but let's face it, Wilder's Wonka makes the audience fear and love him at the same time. With Depp, you have a non threatening wise cracking, high pitched Wonka. Adults will make the connection to Michael Jackson, but it is doubtful that the kiddies will. Highmore does an excellent job with Charlie, and isn't as annoying as the original Charlie. His family also has more interaction. As far as the kids: Augustus was improved, much funnier; Veruca,..well, honestly the original Veruca definitely seemed more like a spoiled little brat, so you were happier to see her go; Mike TV is annoying in both films, however, I kinda liked the original's Jay Leno-ish lisp. The implementation of video games for the new Mike will probably connect better with kids though; Violet was definitely improved, and her mom was just creepy, but thats good.The beloved familiar songs are gone, and while the lyrics of the new soundtrack might be clever and humorous, the accompanying music is too loud and cluttered to hear it. While I was watching, I noticed that most songs ended without a chuckle from the audience, and I attribute that to them being inaudible. The effects were well done, a nice surprise in this era of crap CGI laziness in Hollywood. The Oompas are all the same character, which honestly doesn't really bug me that much. The music is what let me down. I like the background on the Oompas, it added a little fresh air to the movie, and gave you something new, and not redone.You definitely get a little more knowledge of Wonka's background as well as Charlie's family, including a dad that was not present in the first flick. I thought the background story was good, however, it was not presented in a timely fashion. It's hard for this film to compete with the original, just on nostalgic value alone. The original is a bona fide classic, and even though technology has changed, it is not the most important factor. Especially in a movie that is supposed to tug at your heart strings, as well as dazzle your eyes.Children will love it, and maybe cherish it when they are older, as the older generations now cherish the '71 version. But us older folks might leave the theater disappointed, noticing Hollywood's greedy hands as they stick their hands in our pockets while trying to distract us with 'amazing' CGI. Don't get me wrong, like I said before, the CGI was good, and the sets were great, but there was something missing, something needed to draw you in and captivate your imagination. I went into this with a solid confidence that if anyone could or should redo the original, the Burton/Elfman/Depp crew were the ones to do it. I've been a huge fan of the trio since I can remember, and have had, and will continue to have faith in their creativity and vision. Corpse Bride looks awesome, and I'm sure Burton will redeem himself with that one.This is a delicate anomaly of a movie to review, so I'll end with this: Don't see it if you want to see a new, improved original. See it if you are taking your kids and family. The joy that they will get from it might stir up the joy you got from the original, just in case the new one doesn't tickle your fancy.",

And while the violence was as brutal as you would expect from Zombie it seems his imagination ran dry in this second film. You can only be shocked so many times by the sight of a fleshy human mask. Even the characters were not as involving or interesting as they had been in the first film. If it had not been for Sid Haig giving us the Captain Spaulding we came to love from the first movie, it would have been completely worthless. Portions of the film seem to drag on endlessly, especially the scene with the movie expert rattling on and on about the Marx Brothers. I left the theatre feeling almost cheated; the invincible and completely insane characters, which were charming in the first film, had become these motiveless violent foul-mouthed vigilantes that I was loath to watch for two hours. In summation, Rob Zombie took a wonderful cult horror movie and added to it an insidious sequel that is not worth the price of admission.

And I have to say, in defense of 'Killer Shrews' that there is just a hint of something good in this amusing period piece.Let's get a few things out of the way, right up front: The special effects for the title monsters are completely laughable (hand puppets for the close up shots and dogs covered with bath mats for the master shots). And not only do two of the main players have nearly impenetrable accents, the whole film is miked so badly that you can barely catch two words out of every three. The film takes forever to get started, and the first 20 minutes of the film is so static and badly blocked that you want to leave the room yourself to break things up and add some variety. The photography is grainy, badly lit black-and-white, especially in the indoor scenes. Some of the acting is strictly from Amateur Hour (especially the blond beauty pageant winner who we are asked to believe is a research scientist), and the rest of the acting is at the mercy of the plot and the director. The denouement, where the surviving cast members tie together a bunch of barrels that just *happen* to be in their backyard, get under the barrels and essentially barge past the shrews to the beach front - is so silly and badly done that you can't help but chuckle (including some of the most badly staged 'fake walking' you will ever see in a movie). And yet, there is some fun to be had here. The screenplay works mightily to establish an airtight, claustrophobic, no-way-out scenario for the cast. Best's character is articulate and resourceful in a 50's monster movie kind of way. Ken Curtis pulls out all the stops to portray a completely unsympathetic alcoholic, coward, back-shooting Judas and full time punching bag for James Best. The character actor who plays the absent-minded assistant professor actually imbues the role with a certain pleasant humanity and decency in spite of the cardboard nature of the role. There IS a palpable tension, and even anxiety and dread, in some of the scenes that manages to last in spite of the tons of exposition that get piled into the first half of the movie. Three stars out of 10. I can't rate it any lower than that in spite of the relatively low quality because I actually ended up kind of liking it in spite of all its faults - unlike many denizens of the Bottom 100, it tries to be about something, and has a certain innocence and enthusiasm that leavens the silliness and cheapness of the proceedings.",

Those scenes are good, however, the action scenes are what give this a 10. John Woo is the master of gun-play. My favourite parts are Chow's classic \"stair slide\" and the hospital gun fight where Tequila and Tony face off with Mad Dog. When Mad Dog rides into the warehouse and dismounts his bike (and kills) is also stylish and noteworthy. Out of the three John Woo movies I have (A Better Tomorrow-excellent; Once A Thief-meh and Hard Boiled), I'd have to put ABT slightly ahead of this one because of the storyline and Mark's restaurant assassination is my all time favourite gun scene. This may change though, because I have ordered the \"The Killer/Bullet In The Head\" set and am waiting for it to arrive (it went out of stock 2 days after I ordered it, so I have to wait until they restock (fu ckers). However, for pure action, Hard Boiled is the king.",

This film doesn't change that. It does have passable performances from Gabriel Casseus and Raymond Cruz to off-set the outright horrible ones of Antwon Tanner and Kenya Moore. Better than average (at least for direct to video) cinematography is overshadowed by the stale production design, dismal writing, dead action sequences, and repetitive stock hip-hop music. Hip-hop could hack it in a western, just hear T-Bone Burnett's work with the Nappy Roots in \"The Ladykillers\" and imagine the possibilities. But here, it's a complete distraction. How Jean-Claude La Marre ever nabbed David Carradine for this, I can only guess, but he does as good a job as anyone could've done with the writing and, in this kind of wreck, professionalism is the most you could ask for.The last 5 minutes are so pretentious and melodramatic, they border on unwatchable. Please, save the song for the credits next time. If you want the scene to be powerful, give us a character that we have a reason to care about.Here's to the next effort in this sub-genre, may it be something deep and resonant...

I disagree with another reviewer - I thought the first 15 minutes were oddly paced and filmed poorly (the camera is shaking as we look in on the office of a politician initially).However, the film picks up from there with solid, well-developed characters, especially Jamie Foxx playing the role of a smart pilot who expresses the moral quandaries of his work at one point and Jessica Biel as a strong female pilot (both physically and psychologically). The audience enjoyed the movie as you could tell from their laughter at Jamie's quips.While the plot is a bit predictable, it truly is an enjoyable ride. Best of all, my husband is an aerospace engineer and he was impressed with the overall accuracy of the film \"for a Hollywood movie.\" I've had to listen to him (and his co-workers) complain about other movies, but they enjoyed it too - so we give it a thumbs up in you're in the mood for an exciting action movie - or love planes - with just a touch of romance (innuendo only, nothing graphic).",

One of Reeves' best performances. Reeves and Wagner are sweet together and Robert Urich is at his best. The way in which the screenwriter and director went about Urich's character getting his wish was smart. This movie is not at all cheesy like a lot of TV movies. The only flaw in the film is that it is too short(85 min.), so you don't get much of Urich and Wagner together. However, Reeves'charisma saves the film and makes you want more of him than Urich.

Burroughs fanatic).Likewise with Crash, a movie that will have you saying 'what the hell was that all about?' for the rest of the day after watching it, unless you already dig the psychotic, proto-rivet-head literary musings of J.G.

Of course, if you do, then the film won't give you anything new, just provide eve candy to supplant a work you're already familiar with.If you're a fanboy of the dementedly surreal and Cronenberg's perversely postmodern take on social commentary, you'll probably end up with this in the film library; if not, you'll probably be demanding your rental fees back.In a nutshell: like much of Cronenberg's stuff - not guaranteed to make sense to anyone but Cronenberg himself, caveat emptor.",

I am an western so i know from where i speak. The story is combination of politics, history, love and sports (cricket to be exact and you will even learn something about how cricket is played)The music and lyrics are poignant and beautiful. Yes bollywood movies are musicals. The songs in this one deal with British imperialism, love, nature, and life. Most of the dance numbers are staged outside. Some with big flourishes with the entire village dancing. Other times intimate songs and dances that capture the passion of two people in love. The traditional Indian dances are exhilarating and the singing will leave you breathless. Sometimes the songs do repeat themselves so just fast forward them a little. But all in all the musical numbers are captivating and exhilarating. The plot dealing with British imperialism will teach you a history lesson. Political intrigue and an interracial love are the glue that hold it together. You will see the clash between Indian culture and British rule. This film will give you a look into an exotic land that few of us will ever see. And for this alone you should see this film.Do not overlook seeing this movie. This is a musical that uses the power of song and dance to tell a timeless story of people overcoming adversity against tyranny and oppression.",

The story is fun, fresh and full of more than just zombies (although I won't reveal any surprises). The action, when it occurs is fully justified, which is something I always like to see, and is choreographed quite well by Lam Ching-ying. The comedy is somewhat hit or miss, but it didn't bother me very much. I had a lot of fun but I came away wanting more action.

I am not going into spoilers, which would be extremely destructive for a film of this kind but there are very clever character shifts, achieving a wonderful tension lock for the last 40 minutes or so mainly because all the performances are so good. The use of props and flash-backs is also wonderfully rich. The setting is contemporary New Orleans and its surrounds but this is mythical south and none the worse for that. The mix of influences includes 'Turn of the Screw', 'Rosemary's Baby' 'Burn Witch Burn and a few other classics but that is to give nothing away for it absorbs them into something quite new. My only criticism would be there is something a little confined about the movie--especially at its start-- but its style and pace and excitement utilise this triumphantly by the end.",

On the other hand, this recording really shows just how much Michael Wilton (and the rest) can do. The singing is commendable and quite faithful to the originals, containing no ugly visioning or surprises that so typically tend to end up on live records.It is clearly a live show but it manages to have sound and performance \"quality\" rivaling studio recordings.

Kurt wimmer as a director / writer is just great, so is Christian Bale ..amazing acting.. and i also liked the anti-hero taye diggs with his sly smiles and looks not a bad job at all :) the movie could have used a little bit more of realism though, but still as it is its really good and no matter how much i watch it i keep wanting to watch it again...bale's latest movie, batman returns, is not 1/2 as good as equilibrium... my most favorite scenes were not just the fight scenes or gun battles also how they are brainwashing the librarians , how the fight between the underground and the officials is going, but i just wish it wasn't soooooooo over-simplistic at times the storyline...and more depth was given to characterization or environment / setting...still overall its a wonderful movie - one of my favorites - go get it on DVD and watch it NOW u wont regret it :) Salam Aalaykum :)",

I recently watched it again and was more disappointed. The movie is horribly directed and acted all through.It contains unbelievable scene sequence and the story is so unrealistic that it starts to bore after fifteen minutes. I wonder whether there is any connection of the plot with the writing of the legend Marquis de Sade. Everyone in the movie seem to be obsessed with one and only one feeling, and that is sex. The major sex scene at the end of the movie is also unerotic and boring. Don't watch this movie even if u r a fan of Koo Stark.",

Instead of giving the child interviewees a voice and a chance to talk about their lives before and during their military boarding school, this director serves us a series of narrated pathos-embedded statements depicting their awful backgrounds. As the homeless boys in the film are clearly working on restoring their crushed egos by trying to function progressively as group members in an institution accepted and respected by the society they live in, this immature, socio-pornographic primadonna comes with her pathological need to throw Gothic sensations out of her poetic dirt-bag. How little can a person understand the ashamed mind of the homeless and rejected and still be allowed to direct documentaries about this subject? The people awarding this documentary with human rights film prizes have little sense of the actual need the rejected and homeless have to be accepted as strong, progressive, dynamic characters who despite their socially disgraceful backgrounds can have their say in life without being publicly Kain-marked as the hopelessly pitiful.",

The Dead End Kids were great as his friends and followers. One of them right to the very end. Ann Sheridan played the family's daughter and John's eventual love interest.

I don't care what you have to say, However bias it may sound, I just know a good movie when I see one.Not only was it the Best Jet li movie I have seen, I think it was one of my many favorite of many films that I have seen this year. With such great actors like Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins, and Jet li's acting has much improved as well. This movie combines some of my favorite genres from Kung-fu to drama, to action and perhaps even gore, this movie is rather violent. I think it was done so, as to convey the kind of violence that Danny inherited due to his evil master's example/ways. I think the story is perfectly believable, and it just keeps getting better, there isn't a dull moment from the jaw dropping fight scenes, some of jet li's best I think since Fist of Legend, and Once upon a time in china. To the growing relationships between danny and sam, to character and plot development. With a superb soundtrack, done by a great electronic band: Massive Attack. And beautiful cinematography. I have nothing more to say except it's the best movie I've seen all year, I suggest you go see it and enjoy it, as much as I did!",

I rented the DVD and the sound track is terrible for a film from this period. It's hard to make out some of the dialogue, especially when a character turns away from the camera. I hate having to strain to hear dialogue, especially dialogue by Chekhov! It seems to be a recording problem. The film was shot on what seem to be massive stage sets. This family's provincial home looks roughly the size of the Winter Palace. I'm guessing the cavernous sets swallowed up and muffled the dialogue, resulting in the poor sound quality.Aside from the deficiencies of the sound (and there's no excuse for such a problem in a production from 1970 -- fire that sound engineer!) it's a great production of a gently funny and bittersweet classic play.",

        "review_detail": "Sanjay Dutt plays Shaukat, a writer and domineering control freak who tries to force his wife Antara (Aishwarya Rai) into an affair with her colleague Yash (Zayed Khan) in order to survive his writer's block and write a critically acclaimed, bestselling novel. Here's what I got from the movie. (1) - Shaukat plays a control freak to the hilt, who feels like his ability to artistically create something carries over to reality. He fools himself into truly believing in the power of his work, that he's so talented he somehow has the ability to not only control his wife's actions, but also her innermost thoughts and feelings. When Shaukat realizes that he can't control Antara (I can't believe I still remember these names, by the way - I haven't seen the film since opening night back in Feb) he goes insane and loses his own grip on reality. (2) - I don't know why anyone would be interested in this cautionary tale for artists- I think the point of the movie for artists is to realize that you can't take your work so seriously as to have it control you to such an extent as Shaukat did. Realistic, natural art can't be manufactured, it flows from within. He can't forcefully create a love affair between Antara and Yash because this isn't in his control. He's so wrapped up in making a \"realistic\" story after such extreme critical rejection that he tries to force a situation that naturally can't occur. When he realizes that he's ultimately powerless, he loses his mind. Lets look at Shaukat's motivations besides his need for critical success and the desire for the power to make situations happen - his desire to \"play god\" so to speak. Abstract notions aside, I think Shaukat was also bored with his marriage and his life. He marries his student who appears to be a mysterious and beautiful young woman. He sees her as this enigma, a woman who he thinks will always be able to keep him on his toes, guessing. Antara doesn't turn out this way. She turns out to be a simple girl who eventually becomes a professor and falls into a life of predictability in marriage and work. Shaukat's notion of women is anything but simple - his character Tamanna is supposedly based on how he views his wife- mysterious, sexy, beautiful, and ultimately conniving and manipulative. But this is NOT the woman simple Antara really is. He wants to make her into something she's not because he's bored with the real Antara, so he sets out to spice up his marriage through his work by throwing this character based on what he WANTS his wife to be into an affair with Yash. Antara really doesn't enter into an affair with Yash, only managing to stay friends with him and turning him away at the end. So Shaukat fails to recreate his wife's personality and make his wife and marriage more interesting - another ironic reality he can't seem to face. She tells Shaukat in the beginning, while he's having writers block, \"Don't look for your story in me, I'm just a simple woman with simple dreams.\" He doesn't want the simple woman, he wants the temptress he imagines in his writings. Unfortunately for Antara, he prefers Tamanna, evidenced by the her sexy dance he imagines at the restaurant while they're dancing to \"Sholon Si.\" He sees the temptress Tamanna dancing seductively to the music surrounded by men rather than his boring, docile wife Antara, who only manages to submissively slow-dance with him. Ultimately, Shaukat can't face the fact that he's a loser, professionally as a writer and personally as a bored husband. He wants a certain lifestyle of the flashy, sensual, and mysterious wife and a hotshot career as a writer. He ends up a reclusive failed writer living in seclusion and falling into a life of marital boredom. Antara and Shaukat's dance at the end in the asylum is his submission to these facts and willingness to try to accept the ordinary life he has rather than the exciting life he covets.This is a beautiful story of a man who wants too much from life and ends up not getting any of it. It's rather cruel in a way, this writer is given an initial taste of success and a life of fame, only to have it taken away.The performances, barring Zayed Khan who was awkwardly terrible were excellent. Aishwarya plays two different characters - Antara, the vulnerable woman and Tamanna, the bewitching, mysterious, and conniving fantasy Shaukat wants Antara to be. She does both characters remarkably well and with a lot of subtle facial nuances. Her facial expressiveness brings a level of depth to both characters. Sanjay Dutt is brilliant as the alpha-male writer who refuses to accept mediocrity in life and in work. His presence is commanding. No one could have played Shaukat the way he did. Maybe if Bachchan was younger, he'd have the style and panache to do it, but no one else in my opinion. Dutt has that movie-star arrogance and charisma to make the role believable. And he has some smoldering chemistry with Aishwarya Rai. I've never seen Aish look so alluring with another male costar - she's like a block of ice with everyone else. But it looks like she's got a thing for Sanjay with the way they interact on screen. What a great looking couple. The film is beautifully shot, like a wonderfully dark painting. Everything looks classy and gorgeous, especially the songs. The movie may have been confusing but if you take the time to really explore these characters and the untold motivations behind these characters and their actions. It's all there, you just have to think about it and look hard enough. Art is subjective, even if you don't agree with my interpretation, you'll still take something of your own away from the movie. Brilliant, abstract stuff, loved it! 9/10",

Although the ideas and issues are easy to relate to, the same stuff has been explored in many other films, many times before, and the fashion that they are presented in here is very hackneyed. The characters are never better than ordinary, and they are even a tad annoying to have on screen. There is also a severe under-development of Joan Allen's character, as we see her angry, but we do not see her before she changes, and therefore there is no contrast: no visible change. Allen has received a lot of praise for being so angry and stressed, but she is never not - so she is just playing one emotional type - and I cannot call that a good performance myself. The rest of the cast deliver reasonably well, but there are no great performances. I really cannot call this a very good film, but if it could have brought something new in, then I feel the film could have risen above the mark.",

The camera work is at times stunning, putting us not just right on stage at the Grey Fox Festival, but intimately close to instruments played expertly and with great affection. The offerings by Dobro virtuoso Jerry Douglas are by themselves worth the price of the DVD.The directors have inexplicably included a grating scene of a New Age wedding which not only adds absolutely nothing to the film, but detracts from it. One can only speculate as to why they deemed this worthy of our attention, but omitted any portrayal of the hymns and Sunday morning Gospel sings which are integral to the genre, and which grace almost every bluegrass festival I've ever heard of.The unfortunate wedding scene notwithstanding, \"Bluegrass Journey\" is a worthwhile tribute to a truly American art form.",

Despite being mostly an instrumentalist, Steve Vai has a compelling stage presence, and he is in excellent form on this DVD. Not only is he the best, the rest of his band are very skilled musicians and some of the best. Billy Sheehan is simply put, an incredible bassist. Tony Macalpine is a shredder capable of playing some of Steve's hardest lines, but that's not just it, his keyboard skill may even surpass his guitar playing. Dave Weiner is another good guitar player who plays most of the rhythm. And finally, Virgil Donati provides a strong back bone to the whole thing, being a very intense drummer (he also has a drum solo, which starts a little slow, but when it builds up it is amazing). The set is great and contains most of his best songs. The highlights (in my opinion) are: Erotic Nightmares (one of my personal faves), Blue Powder, Little Wing, The Crying Machine, The Animal, Jibboom and The Attitude Song. A Vai tradition, Steve brings up Eric Sardinas (his opening man, also a very good guitar player) for the Attitude Song and extended soloing ensues from all players (at this moment, 4 guitarists and a bassist!). It is also noteworthy that Steve reproduces all effects heard in songs (remember the weird interlude in Blue Powder?). Along with his own songs, two Sheehan songs, two Hendrix covers, a classical piece and Dave Weiner's solo are included. Also, listen to the beginning of Fire where Steve talks about Britney Spears. This is also a trend with him, we got to hear about Britney at the Toronto concert, Heh. If you have any interest in guitar, BUY THIS. Hell, buy it even if you don't.",

It is delightful to see a horror film of this calibre (trash horror) trying its hand at some old fashioned Biblical symbolism, as Marina is enticed by the dark side, or Satan's path, as represented by the witches. This is pure Genesis parody, and the tremendous clout of the chromatic imagery is rival, if not commensurate, to that of Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968). The witches, of course, inhabit a cave, symbolic of that small, hidden alcove in all our hearts where Satan lurks, \"whispering\" to us with his empty promises.

But when I saw it as a teenager (in the 70s) it was heady stuff.Like many older Japanese films, it examines the tug-of-war between rigid social rules and personal desire. Having broken an unyielding taboo, the central characters all pay a terrible price as the romance unfolds. Masayuki Mori is incandescent here, as intelligent and seductive as any male film star you're likely to see.",

So this film sucks. And you know this from the beginning. Because the first scene which should be funny is when Ceausescu is sitting on the toilet and speaks with his wife.

It's a light-hearted film which revolves around a group of social guidance filmmakers who have lost their touch. Add a mysterious loner, a desperate situation, and a few subtle jabs at Hollywood and you have a fun but predictable story. Like many big studio pictures, you know how it's going to end. Luckily, the journey is fun, with some surprising and witty moments. It's interesting how it pokes fun at how out-of-touch filmmakers can be with their audience. If you're a filmmaker or you just love Troy McClure, you'll like this movie.The direction is well paced, I don't remember being bored at anytime during the film. Production values are good, with a fifties' dinerish style of production design and solid cinematography throughout. The acting doesn't go over the top with the comedy except maybe Ted Gregory as the villain. Good script, unexplored territory in some ways.Trapped at a festival full of depressing documentaries about dying children and missing loved ones, this movie was quite refreshing. Go see it if you have a chance. Formosa succeeds where many Hollywood comedies do not--it's entertaining.",

A paradise for the lucky few lottery winners?While one may think this is a rip off on some sub part 70's B flick, I get the feeling this is a segway from Logan's Run, THX 1138 and others. The cast is good, the script is good ... along with the story (important) though some action scenes will stretch (and maybe break?) your belief, these transgressions are minor. All action movies have 'reality' issues.I suppose it is fashionable to bash Micheal Bay. I never really paid attention - but I guess, because of the Pearl Harbor disaster (the film with Ben Afleck, not the actual events from December 7th), people have a deep seated hatred for the director. This hatred is seemingly enhanced by the number of explosions that Bay uses in some of his movies.I think The Island (TI) got a bad rap for product placement. I think this is mostly undeserved. I did think the XBox (live people fighting) was badly placed... it just seemed silly, but other 'placements' seemed very natural - or even funny in a good way. And this leads to the car chase (or one of them). It was much better than the Matrix 2 car chase where all cars seemed to be of a new GM origin and the only cool car was the Camaro (also of GM origin, but at least it had SOME originality). Of course the ads in the movie theater can get annoying ... but that's nothing to do with the movie.I think Bay & Co did a very good job of setting the scene and showing us the human qualities of Jordan and Lincoln. In many ways they seemed more human than the others. Many big questions are raised by this movie and I think many statements are made about the human condition and what people will do to stay alive. How did Lincoln Six Echo develop memories from another person? What kind of influence did the tech/ McCord (played by Steve Buscemi) have on Lincoln. Merrick (Sean Bean) brings up this point, but I think his lack of a real answer makes a bigger statement than anything else.What is real and what is human? What is the nobility of the human spirit ... While these questions are different for everyone I think they are important and should have answers. This movie gives many answers and leaves the right questions.The dialog in TI is good, the actors are good, Scarlet is hot and did well with her role ... I've seen this once and I give it a 9 out of 10.I would go into this movie with as little knowledge about TI, as possible. I would ignore jaded reviewers (professionals who get PAID to review!) who get fussy at the oddest things. I would also ignore the 15 year old retards (is that redundant?) who fail understand that all these ideas are in the public domain and DIRECTORS do not plagiarize (unless they are writers!). I doubt any real 15 year old would get off the Island alive! Maybe the only smart ones are Lincoln & Jordan...MB did a good job. It has a nice build up and then the action is well paced with enough of the old to make the differences stand on their own.",

It's until the spectacular crushing spotlight of total slaughter and revenge executed by Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) when the movie comes alive at all . Previously meeting final tragedy , they contend with each other and finally understand the meaning of life and come to respect each other . It was a troubled issue but with millions dollars budget weighing heavy in the conscience of the producer Ron Howard and director John Hancock led to a real flop and didn't had the wished box office . Big budget production features an impeccable musical score by Carter Burwell and Billy Bob plays the violin , besides it has an incredible number of extras for the Mexican army . The film is correctly based on historic events . The stalwart but tragic defense has become one of American history's most often repeated legends,although historical research has revealed a few facts that go unmentioned.For instance,Sam Houston,commander in chief of the Texas forces,never felt that the crumbling mission could stand up to a siege,and ordered frontiersman Jim Bowie to destroy.He didn't ,however,and rescinded the order and sent attorney turned colonel William B.Travis to defend it.The force that remained in the mission the date the siege began,is estimated at between 182 .Of these less than 20 were actually Texans,the rest including Bowie and another frontier legend,Davy Crookett were volunteers.Early all of them believed that reinforcements were only a short time away.Santa Anna Launched a pre-dawn attack.To the strains of Â¨deguelloÂ¨a battle march indicating that no quarter would be given,or no prisoners taken,some 1800 Mexicans troops stormed the fort.They were thrown back by the cannon and rifles of the defenders,they rushed again,and were repulsed a second time.Eventually Santa Anna sent another wave of troops who broke the outer defenses and forced the Texans to retreat,fighting hand to hand.When the fighting was over,there were no survivors among the defenders.The myth that the garrison fought to the last man ,however isn't quite accurate,since the evidence indicates that Davy Crockett and several others were captured and possibly tortured,then executed.That they died bravely has never been disputed.William Travis who at least according to legend,invited all who would stay and die with him to cross the line in the dirt,fell near a cannon at the north wall.And Jim Bowie,already deathly ill from a sickness that had recently claimed wife and children,fought from his sickbed near the main gate.Like many others among the defenders Bowie was armed with the formidable hunting knife named for him.The legendary defense served as a rallying point for the beleaguered Texas.Although Santa Anna ,who lost at least 600 of some 3000 troops against a force of less than 200,referred as a small affair,the valor of the defenders gave the surviving Texan troops something to remember and thus they did,six weeks later at San Jacinto,but a new battle cry had been added to the annals of American history:Â¨Remember the AlamoÂ¨",

The one disappointment I had was the oompa loompas. Deep Roy is creepy, and the oompa loompas look nothing like the original! The music they sung was awful compared to the first movie. The surreal make up and sets were like a dream. I loved the airbrush look of Willy Wonka and a few of the children. This movie has almost exceeded its successor.",

This film, in fact, might just be my least favorite film he did--it's a close call between this film and Persona.Hour of the wolf is a very surreal film and I think it was deliberately made to be very confusing as to exactly what was occurring--was Max Von Sydow's character a schizophrenic or were there demons or monsters on this island==it's very hard to tell. Frankly, I found myself not really caring.In addition to MANY confusing story elements, you do get to see an old lady pull off her face and put an eye into a glass of water. This isn't really as gross as it sounds. Also, a man walking up a wall and standing on the ceiling and another guy sprout gigantic wings. All this is reminiscent of a painting by Bosch or Dali.",

Some of the supporting characters are not defined well either, and there are a few lethargic gaps between events in the tale. The filming on-location is great, and generally it is all rather well made, but it pales against the work that Merchant-Ivory would produce later on, as this simply is not near a perfect film.",

        "rating": "8",
        "review_detail": "Better Luck Tomorrow is a teen movie, and it's hard to shake it from that category since it is about teenagers in high school and their adaptation to the society around them. However, in this day of age of corny teen movies where there's nudity a plenty, kegs in every other scene and stereotypical ethnic characters, Better Luck Tomorrow is a refreshing reminder that there are other stories of high school that are much darker than the usual. This movie is one of those stories, and even though it starts out a bit slow, and seems to follow in the beginning all of the stereotypes that we are accustomed to seeing in normal run of the mill teen flicks. This film will surprise plenty of audiences and show a much darker brand of people that we aren't accustomed to seeing in this Post-Columbine Era.The story is a bit simple at first, and seems to be the usual garbage that we see in teen movies everywhere: Shy guy is in love with cute cheerleader girl, but is unable to hook up with her. The first thirty minutes seem to be a bit hard to watch, mainly because it seems like this film will be no different than American Pie, but only with Asian-Americans.However, the movie takes a certain turn when the main character begins to meet more Asians like him, and pretty soon, like a house of cards,everything begins to fall apart and he is brought up in a whirlwind of deceit, greed and even murder. Thus, with elements like these, this film keeps the viewer glued to his or her seat awaiting every twisting turn that is going to happen next. Even though the ending is a bit anti-climatic, making the audience wanting to know what would happen next, it is still a story that is truly original and a breath of fresh air from the usual happy go lucky high school stuff.With the cast being primarily Asian, it was interesting to see how the characters would be depicted. With most teen movies, Asians are stereotyped extremely bad, usually playing roles where the English is butchered and they are computer and library nerds that do nothing but study and watch Japanese Animation. However, the characters are a bit two-sided, which is a great credit to the writers of this film. For at first, the movie seems to follow that stereotype, depicting the Asian kids as nerds who competed in Academic Decathalons and wrote liberalized articles for the school newspaper. But, like the plot of the movie, the characters take turns in terms of personality, and throughout the movie the viewer begins to see the savage personalities and the characters that are really behind the masks of those stereotypes. While the screenwriters deserve credit for these characters, the actors are the real winners, for this unknown cast does a great job depicting these two-faced Asian kids that are half-Honor Roll caliber and half-gangsters. The only familiar face in the movie is Harold from Harold and Kumar, but his role is relatively small compared to the other main actors. While it is hard to remember there names off the top of my head, there performances were extraordinary, filled with subtleness, emotion and anger that is characteristic of good actors. This movie is quite a good stepping stone for these young Asian-Amercian actors, and it will be interesting to see what other movies they will grace in next.It won't be surprising to see many Christian parents hating this movie. The issue of teen violence and drug usage is a very sensitive issue in this day of age, especially after Columbine. However, this is a wonderful movie that is savage and enlightening, for it puts a whole new view on Asian American students in high school, and helps destroy the stereotypes that have accompanied them for years. In its essence, this movie is not about high school kids, but about racism to a certain degree. It shows that stereotypes and premature predilections can not always be accurate, and thus should be avoided in our society today. However, that is a complex message and it requires a true intellectual to pick up on the director's message of racism and stereotypes, but if the audience can't pick up that message, there is still one hell of a movie in Better Luck Tomorrow. For it is a teen movie, but a teen movie that has the grittiness of a pulp indie such as Reservoir Dogs, thus making it enjoyable fare for those who have gotten sick of the usual \"boy meets girl\" comedies and dramas.",

Now I must admit up front that I think MOST Godzilla films (apart from the original) are pretty silly. Most of them I saw as a child too young to know better. However, I watched this movie only a day ago because I am crazy enough to WANT to see all 50 of these \"worst movies\".I really don't want to attack the movie for the costumes--after all, these are guys running around in rubber suits and they are rather expected to be cheesy. But the plot--yuck!! It's supposed to be sort of a pro-environment epic teaching us about the evils of pollution (since the monster grew and thrived on all our garbage and clouds of pollution) but I really doubt if very many people will take that message to heart--they'll just laugh! So what in the plot did I think was the funniest (cheesiest)? Well, I loved how the respected scientist seemed to consult with the annoying little kid (he looked about 7) all the time and the kid seemed to know more about the monster than everyone else! This was funniest when the scientist started talking to him about nuclear radiation and then space travel! Second, when the monster began belching out toxic gasses that choked to death or dissolved the unfortunate people nearby, what do all the teenagers do? Yes, have a giant dance party on Mt. Fuiji!!! Cool, Daddy-O!!! So anyways, if you want to see the worst Godzilla flick (and that's saying a lot), give this one a try. If you want to watch a GOOD film, don't give up on Japanese films--they're not ALL this bad!",

        "review_detail": "Nicholas Ray, one of those rare directors who could put in a style or outlook of his own in various films of different conventional types in 1950's Hollywood, has with his film Johnny Guitar a job very well done. I had the chance to see it on the big screen at a revival screening some months ago (mostly among Joan Crawford fans) on a double bill with Sam Fuller's Forty Guns. Crawford, McCambridge, and definitely Sterling Hayden (one of my all-time favorite 'guy' actors) brought a lot to the entertainment factor of the film. The story goes like this (and if you've seen Sergio Leone's Once Upom a Time in the West, you'll notice obvious similarities, as his was a slight homage of this film)- Crawford owns a bar/parlor on the edge of town. The townspeople want her out to make way for a railroad, most vocally of this is McCambridge (in maybe the best performance of the film, really the most theatrical). The title character is played with usual panache by Hayden, who at first is a little enigmatic, then reveals himself to have a past with Crawford. The story then unravels from there, in a way that actually went against my expectations, much to my delight. This is the kind of genre picture that knows what it is, but with a director clever enough to take chances. For example, there is the contrast of color between Crawford and the angry townspeople near the beginning of the film. She's playing the piano on one side of the room in a white dress, while the others, the supposedly 'good' people of the town, are all in black. Is Ray messing with the convention of good guys white, bad guys black, or do we have to keep attentive all the way through to know how it plays out? I think you'd have to - this is one of those westerns that has enough excitement, humor (mostly dark or unintentional), and a climax that goes with some of the best of them. At the least it should hold up for those expecting something very dated- it's not quite as towering as the Leone films, but on its own terms Ray has a contender against all those old-school Ford/Wayne westerns.",

        "review_detail": "I saw this movie years back when it first came out. I was a kid and a wrestling fan at the time, and Hulk Hogan in a movie? You're darned right I'm going! My brother, dad and I went the very first week it opened! Good thing we did, because it didn't last to week two.The movie is basically Hogan as an out of work wrestler. His manager/agent Burt (Sherman Helmsley) can't get him any in ring work because him and Hogan told a promoter they weren't throwing matches. You may say, isn't wrestling scripted like a play? Yeah, but this is 1993. That was still a secret. So anyway, Burt can't put him in the ring so he gets him a job as a body guard for a scientist who just created the chip to some missile or something. Hogan thinks he's golden until he learns that he's not guarding the scientist: he's guarding his kids. The kids are little monsters who have terrorized every nanny they've ever had. Plus one added twist we didn't see coming: HOGAN HATES KIDS!!! So who will have the last laugh, Hogan or the kids? The answer: not the audience.The kids play cruel jokes on Hogan in order to get him to leave. These include short-sheeting his bed, making his exercise bike go really fast and causing him to fall into a pool of red seaweed. I know. The horror. Hogan sticks in there, though, and gets the kids to like him once he spends time with the daughter Kate and teaches the son Alex how to stick up for himself. Of course the son uses his brains, because violence is never the answer. Especially when an ex pro wrestler is on the job.The kids finally fall in love with the Hulkster for good when he punishes them. If God were kind it would be by him giving Alex a big boot and dropping the legdrop on Kate. Sadly, he doesn't even give the \"YOU!!!\" finger. After making them sit on a couch for about an hour, the kids finally respect him and listen. Because their dad never did it and that's why he failed, get it? The movie finally ends when the villain who is trying to steal the chip turns out to be the same wrestling promoter Hogan and Burt told to take a hike years back. That's right: a wrestling promoter turned world-domination villain. Not even Vince Russo could write that piece of gold! The villain, who has a metal skull cap for reasons I don't have the energy to type, is finally vanquished and Hogan isn't needed anymore. But he doesn't leave empty handed. He learns an important lesson about a children's love. Plus he ties Kate's dolly to his motorcycle. And good times are had by all. Except those who have sat through this piece of crapola.I loved this movie when I was a kid. I watched it over and over (haven't watched it since and I still know the whole story). I laughed my head off every time and wondered why it didn't stay in the theaters longer.Now? Oh, I'll still watch it. But not because I think it's good.",

        "rating": "1",
        "review_detail": "PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its confusing plot line and horrible acting.First, let's tackle the characters. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to hold an outrageous, boiling anger throughout the entire film, which is due to her overwhelming passion to become prom queen. However, it becomes completely unknown to the audience why Cherry wants to become prom queen in the first place. Before the nominations are even read off, she storms around the school with a constant disinterest upon being there, and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with. Why does she care so much to be their prom queen? Brooke Balderson apparently presents an \"acclaimed\" performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face, stomping around, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you handed any young actor/actress a script that only requires him/her to act insanely angry, you're not asking for much. You're also not allowing the character to develop very well.Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her character whatsoever. When being harassed by her principal, she knocks him down (after several seconds) with no feelings of disgust or shock or anything equally traumatizing. Her lines are read like she is reading trivia off the back of a cereal box.Throughout the rest of the film, the students in charge of his kidnapping sound more like they are planning a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their principal, sitting tied up in their basement.Meanwhile, Cherry is off killing several female prom queen candidates, and no one even notices or cares. (Yeah, I get it, I get it, the whole town is worried about prom. Very realistic. At least you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops, but that might be asking too much.) For example, right after Cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of students, Beth is found being interviewed by the local media. The reporter mentions \"the shooter\" in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students, but then one second later asks, \"What do you think about guns in the hands of minors?\" or something to that effect. Where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over, with the media showing up again, Beth simply adds that \"she understands (Cherry's) need to be heard\" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unaltered mood. No one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder.Not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town, Julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at her house (Maybe I'm a little left out of the scene, but last time I knew, high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their \"I'm so indie and mod\" attitudes), Beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic.The only compliment I can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful. The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and crisp with each shot.Too bad the acting and script aren't.",

I would point to Alexander Knox's performance in a supporting role, for one. Sessue Hayakawa, as the old fascist surviver, is also good.On the other hand, Florence Marly is pretty weak as the love interest and the plot is somewhat routine. The main plot problem is the Bogart/Marly relationship. There is just too much resemblance to the relationship between Rick and Ilsa in \"Casablanca.\" When you add in Marly's unconvincing performance, the chances of a having a first-rate film are slim. I must also add, reluctantly, that Bogie seems to be walking through this role, much as he did in another Santana film, \"Sirocco\" (1951).That brings me to my final point. Bogart had started Santana Productions in about 1948. \"Knock On Any Door\" was the company's first effort, and it was somewhat popular at the time. \"Tokyo Joe\" was the second Santana production. As a small start-up independent production company, Santana did not have a stable of outstanding actors to call upon. Perhaps that is why they had to make due with a Florence Marly instead of a top female lead to go opposite Bogart.It's also true that \"Chain Lightning,\" 1950, Bogie's next to last Warner Bros. release, wasn't so hot. Maybe the era of the tough but decent Bogart character had simply run its course.I might add here that the third Santana production was \"In a Lonely Place,\" 1950, one of Humphrey Bogart's best, though perhaps most under-appreciated, films.Give \"Tokyo Joe\" a try. It's no world beater, but I have watched it several times, and still find it entertaining.",

I never would have expected this type of character from her, but she's fantastic. Brad Rowe is a charming dweeb, and his character's insecurity works. Samaire Armstrong finally gets a leading role, and it's her best performance ever! She's probably got the most complex role in the film (I won't spoil the surprise), and plays the varying levels of her character to perfection. Jonathan Penner (loved him in \"The Last Supper\" with Cameron Diaz) comes on with a vengeance as a classic dirt bag.

About the only shortcoming was the possibility that many viewers will be beguiled into thinking ALL cases of schizophrenia were caused by childhood trauma or conflicts. This analytic school of thinking was fathered by Freud and was very popular in the 1940s, though nowadays, most experts would agree that there is a very strong biological component to schizophrenia and few cases are the direct result of poor parenting.

However, I just found myself pretty bored by the picture and felt that watching practically EVERYONE (from the rich jet-setters to the servants) bouncing from partner to partner was not my cup of tea. It actually was rather funny that although practically everyone was cheating on their spouses in the film, they never really seemed to get around to having sex. Mostly, they just seemed to go through the motions of wooing and sneaking about instead of any real infidelity.Although a few Hollywood films have similar story elements, this movie stands in sharp contrast to the average American film. The French in the 1930s would probably have seen most Americans in films of the day as uptight and too conventional, while Americans would have been amazed at how fixated the French were on infidelity. Even way back then, the differences in the two cultures seem extreme when we view them in film.By the way, Octave is actually played by the director, Jean Renoir.",

After having turned it on and shut it off on at least 10 successive occasions, I finally made it to the end tonight. You see, every time I fired it up I thought, \"The rest of it can't possibly be as awful as the part I just watched. They can't possibly insult the viewer's intelligence any more than they have.\" The filmmakers proved me wrong each time.The script was clunky, the photography is badly framed and poorly shot, and much of the film just doesn't make any sense. Also, there isn't a single sequence the conclusion of which you can't see coming from a mile away- come on, of COURSE Johhny's \"side\" was going to win the impromptu football game when he has one hand shackled behind his back- and his girl is the prize! And Johnny Walker strutting down the Main street of his staid, middle-American town dressed like he's on his way to a Gay bar on Cowboy Night?! How ELSE would his straight-laced family react than with shock, indignation and disgust? As to the actors, Uma is lovely, Downey is Downey (and I admit is pretty good in his standard hopped-up sidekick role, especially in the motel scenes,) but Hall seems completely uninterested in what he's doing. He really acts as if he didn't really want to do this film, in spite of the fact that he DID want a vehicle that would break his Brat Pack Geek-in-Chief image. I felt sorry for him. He was really cute, but that was it. His character, Johnny Walker, speaks to a crowd of having embarrassed himself towards the end of the picture. To me, it seemed that Hall delivered those lines with utter conviction, and I'm not surprised. If this were on my resume, I'd deny it. Hall has, of course, gone on to a viable and even admirable career. I guess it's really true that you can't keep a good man down, even if he makes such a potentially suicidal career choice as this film. It's a testament to the man's drive and determination to succeed that he left trash like this far behind him and kept working.Another gripe I have: screenwriters Zacharias and Buhai wrote the original \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" so they ought to have known what would work in a Youth comedy. Apparently they forgot.The two worst aspects of this film, however, were these: first, it was unbelievably boring (and a bad movie that is boring is the worst bad movie of all); secondly, the lampooning of corruption in collegiate football is a viable topic and it could have worked if the script had been decent, the story been told in a logically plotted arc, Bud Smith hadn't directed and Hall had acted like he cared (and not mumbled his lines as if he were auditioning for the first time at a Junior High School's offering of Romeo and Juliet.) I give this ludicrous waste of my time a 1.",

They have little to say to one another -- leaving the camera with little to do than dwell on the appealing, if alienated female lead character. The hand-held cameras and long, wordless closeups of alternately bored and hopeful Karen give the film a feeling of aimlessness combined with pretension.

        "review_detail": "OK, this follows the plot line of almost any no-fail-direct-to-video b movie. Group of kids following a few of the stock archetypes (stoners, oversexed girls and their horny boyfriends, idiot leader, clichÃ© pseudo-intellectuals... et cetera) are out on some voyage. Our director chose one of the more popular type: camping. So they go out camping, have a rough start, meet Gary Busey (THIS IS CRUCIAL!!!), and set out into misadventure. Of course, they end up staying in a cabin that belongs to Jeremiah.Luckily for the audience, Jeremiah starts to remove from society our lovable youthful cast, as per every b flick. For the most part the movie was done really well. Scenes to remember include: Harold, the Janitor, and his criticism of modern amenities and philosophy; Every scene with the Sheriff or his bumbling deputy; and the chicken store/gas station.At the chicken farm, Gary Busey stars as the butcher in one of his best rolls ever. He is witty, nutty, covered in blood, and best of all, in a light blue three piece suit and tie. Bam, phenomenal. Honestly, he was the entire reason I rented the film. When it comes down to choosing from Hasting's array of B Horror movies, touting Gary Busey is important. Especially when he is THE FIRST CREDITED ON THE BACK. In the synopsis on the case, it even makes mention of his character. -- hardcore -- or so I thought...Attention, spoiler to follow: Gary Busey is in this movie for approximately two minutes. He makes those two minutes worth it, but I spent the ENTIRE DURATION OF THE FILM WAITING FOR HIM TO SHOW UP AGAIN... and he never does. This pisses me off to no end because his NAME WAS FIRST CREDITED AND HIS PICTURE IS ON THE DVD CASE. Yes, on the DVD jacket cover, Gary Busey's picture is two to three times larger than the actual stars of the film. I figure in the world of 'super size' and 'texas' bigger is better and more important. Well, apparently I was had because Gary Busey (who is credited as the star of the movie... or so it seemed) is a bit part and he NEVER COMES BACK. Gentle reader, please do not expose yourself to this example of capitalist crap. Instead, let me direct you to a much better film: House of the Dead.House of the Dead is based off the Arcade Game of the same name (yes, the one we all spent our allowance in at Aladdin's Castle). At any rate, there are zombies (which make much better villains than Jeremiah any day), guns, fake raves, the Puget Sound, and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. The best part of the movie is that it advertises JÃ¼rgen Prochnow (yes, THE JÃ¼rgen Prochnow from Das Boot) and JÃ¼rgen makes the movie worth watching. Also, hes in the flick for a decent amount of time, esp. for a bit part.Love, Matt",

It was not intended to be a finished commercial film. Although the production is crude, the film deserves judgment on the basis of the depth of its story line. The story line is about the lack of depth and meaning in pop culture in the U.S. at the time (1966).Milius does not strive to create \"pretty\" films. He strives for a deep story line, with \"powerful and meaningful\" images.This film is the start of his unique style. It is a style that is emerging, after decades, as a unique characteristic of American Film that has had an uncredited influence on filmmakers across the globe for close to fifty years.This film is important because it was the beginning point for Milius' contribution of a style emphasizing depth and meaning in American popular films.",

Curious that there were no more shows like this done by the Beatles.The Beatles finish the show, performing their hits, including a rare medley. Curious thing: the music was live, but pre-recorded, and all the musicians are miming to their songs. John Lennon didn't have a harmonica to play the opening harmonica riff from \"Love Me Do\", so he just mimed playing one. The \"Shout!\" number was a standard Mersey Beat audience participation song.

Pollard has created a sure-footed send-up of modern romance and what happens when devotion goes over the edge. Camera-work and settings around Kentucky were beautiful, creating a different spin from the constant romance-in-a-big-town-between-overeducated-professionals genre we all know too well.Story splits its time between David (Gil Bellows of \"Ally McBeal\" & \"Shawshank Redemption\"), a popular (and married) local radio talk-show host and Melody (Jennifer Westfeldt of \"Kissing Jessica Stein\"), an attractive pharmaceutical saleswoman traveling through town to see her boyfriend, Sean (Christian Kane, \"Angel\" & \"Friday Night Lights\"). David meets Melody by chance after she humiliates Sean by turning down his very public marriage proposal. As a friendship develops between the two, we learn than Sean's not going to give up so easily on Melody and that David's perfect life as upstanding pillar of the community may not be what it seems...Pollard deftly moves between romance, satire and unfolding mystery without ever letting his story run low on gas. The storyline is tight and the dialog is witty, funny and crisp. Realistic characters have to work around their warts, which creates a very funny commentary on marriage, dating and romantic obsession. Jennifer Westfeldt is particularly good at making a lot out of her neurotic beauty Melody, and she does look good here. Very nice use of multiple subplots and supporting characters (including \"Mike Hammer\" Stacy Keach and Elizabeth Pena of \"Jacob's Ladder\"). The story will keep you guessing until the last shot.Good solid entertainment- keep an eye out for director Pollard in the future. 8/10",

As soon as the shortcut to \"The Parade\" appeared and earnest attempts to portray early 1980's life in Britain were replaced with 'Let's Do It First On TV' storytelling, Brookside lost, no, not it's appeal, but it did lose it's wonderful immediacy and realism.

There were some worms... and some hopping vampires (sweet... that's why I gave this film higher than a 1) Avoid this film at all costs, unless you wanna get drunk and laugh at the horrendous dubbing with friends. (I watched the first hour subbed but it was so horrid that we switched to dubbed for the end... and no I wasn't under the influence of alcohol when watching it.)",

        "review_detail": "Good film, better made than Cabiria and more watchable. Maciste is quite charismatic, and there are several fun, if silly, set pieces that keep the movie going.I prefer this Maciste film to Cabiria quite a bit. Maciste Alpino is funny, silly and quite well made, definitely improved by the advances in storytelling technique between 1914 and 1916. Maciste is the name of a secondary 'strongman/superman' character from Cabiria. He was so popular he was put into a ton of serials and films starring just his character. At the Breakout of World War I, this film was made to galvanize patriotic enthusiasm for the war. The film starts with Maciste and a company of filmmakers shooting a new Maciste film. Then they realize that war has broken out and they are arrested and sent to a concentration camp. It's not long before Maciste plans an escape and takes the camp with him. He joins up and they move into the mountains. There Maciste tracks down and captures a foreign commander and drags them down the mountain to much humorous effect. Then he leads his entire company over the mountain to rout the enemy. They come down the mountain into the backyard of a mansion where a damsel in distress is in danger of being ravished. Naturally, though Maciste doesn't know of her, Maciste leads the charge through defenses three times their numbers and just manages to save the girl at the last moment. Hurrah for Maciste, the end.It's a pretty good film, slow in some parts but an enjoyable silent film. Maciste's character is quite charismatic to watch, in fact he looks quite a lot like the wrestler The Rock. The plot is thin and makes the whole war seem minor and silly, but it's an enjoyable film and more watchable than Cabiria because the technique is much more sophisticated.",

        "review_detail": "The Devil's Rejects hit me like a sucker punch. Being a fan of 70s horror in general, I was a big fan of House of 1000 Corpses when it came out. For all the major bashing it took for its campiness, borrowing from other sources, and pseudo-art house aspirations, I found it to be enjoyable, simple horror that didn't take the genre TOO seriously, without being mean spirited. When I sat down in the theater for The Devil's Rejects, I wasn't really prepared for the genius bit of cinema Rob Zombie created. While the touches of camp humor and over the top violence linger, the film itself was beautiful, multi-layered, and unique.While Corpses set up the deranged Firefly family as a stock group of serial killers, straight out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, TDR refined the characters, making for a movie that was much more realistic. Sheri Moon drops the annoying cackle this time around, in favor of sly deviousness and frantic bloodlust as Baby. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding becomes the villain everyone suspected he was in Corpses, while providing most of the movie's comic relief. But it is Bill Mosely who is the true standout as Otis Driftwood. While the Otis of the previous installment is terrifying at times, many of his mannerisms and lines are derivative of Charles Manson, pushing the boundaries from crazy to just plain funny (the lines about \"scooping ice cream for s**theel friends\" still makes me crack up). This humor is mostly gone from Otis. He is dark, deranged, and murderous, but the love and protection he offers to his \"family\" truly challenged me as a viewer, and awed me to Mosely's subtle and amazing performance. Granted, he still has a few great, hilarious lines, specifically one referencing that OTHER madman in theaters right now, Willy Wonka.Aside from the Firefly clan, the supporting cast is terrific. William Forsythe is powerful and chilling as the sheriff driven by his brother's murder to enact revenge just as grisly as the Fireflys' crimes. The gang from \"Banjo & Sullivan\" are utterly believable and help create some of the film's most haunting moments. Ken Foree is a delight to genre fans who will recognize him as the young cop in the original Dawn of the Dead, here portraying a struggling pimp with ties to Captain Spaulding. Danny Trejo and Diamond Dallas Page provide some truly sleazy moments as the Unholy Two, bounty hunters who are just as amoral as their prey. A truly stellar ensemble cast indeed.Rob Zombie nearly upstages this cast, however, with a script and style as visceral as the grittiest of 70s slasher originals (Last House on the Left, the Hills Have Eyes, and Texas Chainsaw all come to mind). Make no mistake, the Firefly family is vicious, unrepentant, and probably deserve the worst punishments Sheriff Wydell has in mind. They are rapists, killers, and sadists; in short, they are the darkest heart of America, and humanity itself. Why then do we pull for them? Why yearn for their escape? This is what puzzled and confused me, challenged me to think, and in short why I left the Devil's Rejects speechless. While some complained that it was not really scary, I found it truly frightening; that Rob Zombie could give a glimpse into the darkest acts of human depravity and still find some kinship with the perpetrators of such evil scared me. Unlike the over the top killers of House... this Firefly clan has bonds as strong as any family, and scant remnants of redemption beneath layers of evil.Visually, the film is stunning. Stark without being clichÃ©d, Zombie pulls no punches and delivers a haunting vision of the heart of America. While some have complained it is \"not a real horror film,\" Zombie's vision is more frightening than any pilfered Americanized Japanese horrors of the past few years. Cannot come more highly recommended from a fan of the genre. If you're prepared to take a chance and be repulsed and drawn in to a world of depravity, see the Devil's Rejects.",

        "review_detail": "When I went to see this movie I expected that the suspense and violence would be top notch, yet I was sort of let down. First off I would not classify this as a horror flick, it was more of a thriller/western/revenge film. The devil's reject group was more subdued this film, less killing, not to dramatic when they killed first lady all the way to the lady running with her husbands face on hers. I mean hell when tiny escapes at the beginning (avoids being captured) you know hes going to do something in the end to help the TDR out. That and the only people I would classify in this film as psychos were otis and the sheriff, they did most of the killing. I have to hand it to the lady who played Mother firefly she was acting like a total nut/psycho and it was great all the way til she got hers really made he character believable. Baby just sucked, no laughing, just acting like a 8 year old most of the time (plus being able to throw that knife through that ladies chest plate, crap!!!). Captian spaulding was pretty much the same character from the first although he seems to have it more together in this film, plus it showed hes not above harpooning whales. Otis was more like a lunitic woodsmen with that beard of his. The sheriff reminded me of some crusader nutjob who was just as violent, but somehow holy. But other than that most of the characters were just to bland to be remembered, too static. Hell I didn't even remember the bands that was killed nor the people killed, or why I should have even cared about what happened to them.Too much of this movie just did not sit well with me, it just wasn't what I was looking for. I would say i liked HOTC more because of the pure violence and satism (I know zombies not a Satan lover, besides that stuffs BS) That and bullcrap \"we got the drop on you\" then messed it all up.Hopefully Mr. Zombie keeps making films he seems like hes caught onto the right track to revived horror moviesl, though next time leave out the god damn 5 min montage at the end.",

        "review_detail": "...that goes without saying that it isn't by a lot. In a way, Rob Zombie's second film, 'The Devil's Rejects', affected me the same way his music does- it's usually self-indulgent, stylized like it's nobody's business, and at times its fairly entertaining stuff, but you know while you're listening to it there's better material in the genre. His first film, 'House of 1000 Corpses', was below average for my tastes, as he reveled in the fact that he was a writer/director of a horror film by making a Oliver Stone-esquire pastiche of the genre. This time around, he goes for a more conventional narrative, though saying that one must take into account that its in the framework of a raw, un-hinged, demented, exploitation crime film. So, there are some good points about it, if muddled under by the flaws.As with 'Corpses', the film is style over substance, or story- the characters from the last film, the 'Fireflies' (led by Sid Haig, in a cheerfully disturbing performance), are on the lam from Texas troopers, most particularly the vengeful Sheriff (played by William Forsythe, overplayed for good and bad results) who'll stop at nothing to see they pay for their crimes. On the way to hideout among friends (one of which Ken Foree, one of several obvious nods Zombie makes to past exploitation/horror films with cameos and small parts), they continue the carnage. While watching the film though, one isn't as concerned with any real story as much as just the atmosphere, the fiends and victims who populate this late 1970's hillbilly environment Zombie has sprung up.The good parts are these- Zombie shows himself to be fairly adept at writing scathingly (and I mean scathingly like a iron to the face) witty dialog at times, mostly tongue-in-cheek, and has moments of inspired wild-ness in his style. He also has the good knowledge to let his actors go as nuts as possible, which helps at times to heighten the mood. But this leads into the bad sides of the film, one which some won't be bothered by (mostly die-hards I'd figure to exploitation flicks of the 70's) and some may be even more repulsed by than me: the Fireflys are, by Zombie's manipulation, by default the most sympathetic characters of the movie (when compared to the 'evil' police that is, and the innocuous victims). The problem is, despite some attempts to make them charming by some stretch, to get a viewer on the side of the anti-heroes, he doesn't succeed on this level.During parts of the film, including the ending scene (I won't reveal it, but to give an idea of the scene it's done with Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' blaring out), I started to think about another filmmaker who's gone in the realm of the take-no-prisoners, on the side of the outlaws film-making, Quentin Tarantino. He's not a filmmaker immune to criticism, but in the sort of side-world he's created with From Dusk till Dawn and the Kill Bill films (connected by some similar characters) the anti-heroes have a kind of balance with their more sadistic and 'bad' side to get a viewer rooting for them almost. Zombie is so in love with his style of film-making and these people he's created, that he doesn't realize that these aren't very charming people at all (bullies and children almost all the way through), and as the film heads towards a climax, it's hard to really root for anyone. Maybe that's the point, as a satire, but I just didn't get it, and by the big finale on a road in Texas, the whole experience of the film felt a little, well, average when in regards to the other 'shock' films Zombie pays tribute to.In short, the excesses that Zombie went with in 'Corpses' have sort of lingered on in 'Rejects', and while there are some curious and 'cool' bits scattered about (along with a very good classic/souther-rock soundtrack), it becomes a little boring at times too. I'm sure after this film that Zombie may make more movies, better ones perhaps, but with 'Rejects' he has made an uncompromising, violent, torrid, amusing, and ludicrous work here that does everything to call attention to itself...akin to his solo music work. It's the kind of film I can recommend more to some than others.",

The barbs trading back between Amanda and Buttermaker are funny, as THornton has a great screen chemistry with his younger co star. Not suing Kelly Leak in the original, and not having the classic Rudy Stein characters are a few of the drawbacks,as is not using Amhad's hank Arron loving character (this time around Admand's favorite player is Mark McGwire, who the producers decided correctly to make a punchline) but the biggest drawback is Greg Kinnear as the Yankee's coach. Years removed from battling Ben Stiller to pull off the worst performance in the 1998 crapfest Mystery Men, Kinnear is stiff, not believable, and pretty much close to effeminate. kinnear almost pulls the whole movie down by himself with his wooden performance. While no one can even touch the late Vic Morrow's portrayal in 76, Kinnear's performance in terrible, and him being casted in the role is outright unacceptable. Tanner Boyle was thankful toned down from the 1976 classic, and is no longer spoutting racist words. He still manages , however, to be the team's badass with a mouth that would make sailor's blush.

Argue what you want, but it's hard to dismiss his work as not at least entertaining, if not more than occasionally quite absurd. You see ever dollar up on the screen and every shot looks like it was painstakingly produced (which has also been a regular source of ridicule as well as praise). Forget every other film he's made and let's get to this one.Far more intellectual than what you might expect, don't be surprised if your mind does not occasionally start to dwell on debates of morality and what makes a human being, well, a human being. There are harsh criticisms made about our society and our human nature to the point that you will find yourself demonizing most of the human characters and identifying with the pure, selfless and ideal nature of the protagonists. Our heroes are after all, basically children and therefore have an uncorrupted view of right and wrong, and act on those impulses accordingly. There are some very ugly reminders of what man has been capable in the service of his own selfish objectives, and man's capacity to rationalize the persecution or extermination of other humans and animals as either necessary or because the obstacles are less than human in their eyes. We are quite literally even reminded of the horrors of the Holocaust in a harrowing incinerator scene. We further have our our recall stimulated of another recent act of inhumanity when a major character speaks of a their parents part in resisting the warlords victimizing civilians in Africa. All pretty heavy stuff from the guy who directed the BAD BOY movies. Now, make no mistake, this is still Bay spectacle stuff here, but even much of that has the unique feeling of real and tangible. The cities seem functionaland one conceivable in the near future. There is not a lot of incomprehensible techno jargon to bombard you either. Even the chases, clearly inspired by other action films themselves (even Bay references himself here) seem fresh and clever. It's worth the ticket price. You get some real inner debate and creepy but intelligent suspense and some genuinely exciting chases in a believable futuristic world. If you take healthy doses of THX-1138, LOGAN'S RUN and a better realization of the B Movie FREEJACK (yeah, there's a bit of that movie in here too) and an obscure flick MST3K fans will recognize called CLONUS then you have a pretty good idea what to expect here, and you know what?

While few of the ideas posited in this new film are 'new', Bay and screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have done a more than serviceable job of recycling ideas from other movies that arrived D.O.A.'The Island' is of course a remake of 'Parts:The Clonus Horror', one of the most sordid of D-grade Mystery-Science Theater 3000 candidates - 'Coma' made on a budget of $350,000. Straight-to-video? Straight-to-the-SciFi Channel? Not even close. Even Albert Pyun never managed to stink 'em up this bad - though he came close, many a time.But I'm supposed to be talking 'The Island' here, and not 'The Clonus Horror'. The Island' is a good movie, built on a solid script, excellent production values and sound performances delivered by A-list actors. As I sat in the theater watching this movie, I found myself going through a mental checklist, \"'Logan's Run', check. 'The Island of Dr. Moreau', check. 'Brave New World', check. 'Revenge of the Sith', check. There are even shades of 'Total Recall' and 'Gattaca' buried in here, as the film is a dystopia-buried-in-a-futuristic-consumer-fantasy kind of flick. The question remains, though - was this picture brought to fruition by Michael Bay, or just one of the higher-ups at Dreamworks SKG - SKG as in Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen.Ewan MacGregor redeems himself here, for the 6 years he spent trying to imitate Alec Guiness in the woebegone 'Star Wars' prequels. There's a wonderful long moment in the film where we're reminded he was once Scottish - 'Shallow Grave', 'Trainspotting' anyone? And OMG! Scarlett Johansson is actually a fairly attractive woman - I really couldn't tell before, with her abused girlfriend and serfdom turns in 'Lost In Translation' and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. Again, who knew? But the former Director Bay manages to shine through in some areas, with his signature explosions and oddballs in the supporting cast: Steve Buscemi, showing greater range than evidenced before, demeans himself once again, while Ethan 'Neelix' Philips shows up to disgrace himself as a roly-poly balding-on-top Stryker refugee.For shame! Is it possible to have a Michael Bay movie without cartoonish archetypes? Michael Mann got over it - I suggest that Bay get ahold of the manual and further his attempts at meaningful content. There may be something more memorable than 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor' in Bay's future. Let's hope that he's able to continue the evolution and that audiences can catch up.",

        "review_detail": "vimukthi jayasundara's debut feature is a film of surprising stillness and serenity. it strikes you by being so unusual and so brilliant at the same time. the film deservingly won the camera d'or for best first film at cannes this year.the film is an expression of misery that is the result of many decades of civil war in sri lanka. the landscape comes across as desolate and an aura of death can always be sensed. the people living in this land seem robbed of their humaneness. they're like automatons, functioning for the sake of functioning. their only source of pleasure are brief, emotion-less sexual 'quickies'.one filmmaker jayasundara is obviously influenced by is tsai ming liang (taiwan). like liang, jayasundara's characters are alienated from everything human. lonely, disconnected and indifferent to their own tragedy, they inhabit a world devoid of intimacy. but jayasundara goes beyond the mysteriously fascinating imagery of liang to create a more engaging and almost hypnotic film.if you're expecting a film in which something happens all the time, or you're looking for overt meaning in every scene, this is not your cup of tea. there is very little dialogue. the film is full of long takes and moves at a leisurely pace. the director shows a kind of indifference to plot. a scene is not a build up to the future, the essence of the movie lies in each and every scene in itself. surrender your intellect, stop trying to find meaning, just put forward your hand like a child and let the film guide you through its desolate, detached beauty. unlike what many might say, this is NOT an intellectual's film. on the contrary, its a film that requires you to not use your mind too much and to view the film in an unconditioned way, not expecting it to go this way or that. it completely goes against what we are habituated to. the film's progression from a beginning to a middle to a climax is not important. life doesn't move like that.vimukthi jayasundara clearly belongs to that set of directors who talk in a cinematic language that is liberated from the literary, plot-driven narrative. partially because i do not view this kind of cinema very often, the film leaves you with a sense of calm and an appreciation for its inventive brilliance. on the low side, the style is detached and distant and lacks the ability to manipulate your feelings like a well-crafted, plot-driven film. i don't quite know what to make of these feelings. its a film that you won't forget and will really want to talk about and discuss.",
